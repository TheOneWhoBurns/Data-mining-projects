 as from a fallen idol she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions The great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum the famous divine flirted openly with one of the Madame de Staels of the age who looked daggers at another Corinne who was amiably satirizing her after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher who imbibed tea Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible The scientific celebrities forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods gossiped about art while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy the young musician who was charming the city like a second Orpheus talked horses and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party Before the evening was half over Jo felt so completely disillusioned that she sat down in a corner to recover herself Mr Bhaer soon joined her looking rather out of his element and presently several of the philosophers each mounted on his hobby came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess The conversations were miles beyond Jo s comprehension but she enjoyed it though Kant and Hegel were unknown gods the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms and the only thing evolved from her inner consciousness was a bad headache after it was all over It dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces and put together on new and according to the talkers on infinitely better principles than before that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness and intellect was to be the only God Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort but a curious excitement half pleasurable half painful came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space like a young balloon out on a holiday She looked round to see how the Professor liked it and found him looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear He shook his head and beckoned her to come away but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy and kept her seat trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs Now Mr Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions not because they were unsettled but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken As he glanced from Jo to several other young people attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics he knit his brows and longed to speak fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand He bore it as long as he could but when he was appealed to for an opinion he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of truth an eloquence which made his broken English musical and his plain face beautiful He had a hard fight for the wise men argued well but he didn t know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man Somehow as he talked the world got right again to Jo The old beliefs that had lasted so long seemed better than the new God was not a blind force and immortality was not a pretty fable but a blessed fact She felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again and when Mr Bhaer paused outtalked but not one whit convinced Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him She did neither but she remembered the scene and gave the Professor her heartiest respect for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there because his conscience would not let him be silent She began to see that character is a better possession than money rank intellect or beauty and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be truth reverence and good will then her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good but great This belief strengthened daily She valued his esteem she coveted his respect she wanted to be worthy of his friendship and just when the wish was sincerest she came near to losing everything It all grew out of a cocked hat for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head which Tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off It s evident he doesn t look in his glass before coming down thought Jo with a smile as he said Goot efening and sat soberly down quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein She said nothing at first for she liked to hear him laugh out his big hearty laugh when anything funny happened so she left him to discover it for himself and presently forgot all about it for to hear a German read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation After the reading came the lesson which was a lively one for Jo was in a gay mood that night and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment The Professor didn t know what to make of her and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible Mees Marsch for what do you laugh in your master s face Haf you no respect for me that you go on so bad How can I be respectful Sir when you forget to take your hat off said Jo Lifting his hand to his head the absent minded Professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat looked at it a minute and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol Ah I see him now it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my cap Well it is nothing but see you if this lesson goes not well you too shall wear him But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat and unfolding it said with great disgust I wish these papers did not come in the house They are not for children to see nor young people to read It is not well and I haf no patience with those who make this harm Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic a corpse a villain and a viper She did not like it but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano It was not however and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it there would have been no name to betray her She had betrayed herself however by a look and a blush for though an absent man the Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied He knew that Jo wrote and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once but as she never spoke of it he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own and it troubled him He did not say to himself It is none of my business I ve no right to say anything as many people would have done He only remembered that she was young and poor a girl far away from mother s love and father s care and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle All this flashed through his mind in a minute but not a trace of it appeared in his face and by the time the paper was turned and Jo s needle threaded he was ready to say quite naturally but very gravely Yes you are right to put it from you I do not think that good young girls should see such things They are made pleasant to some but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash All may not be bad only silly you know and if there is a demand for it I don t see any harm in supplying it Many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories said Jo scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin There is a demand for whisky but I think you and I do not care to sell it If the respectable people knew what harm they did they would not feel that the living was honest They haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum and let the small ones eat it No they should think a little and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing Mr Bhaer spoke warmly and walked to the fire crumpling the paper in his hands Jo sat still looking as if the fire had come to her for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney I should like much to send all the rest after him muttered the Professor coming back with a relieved air Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make and her hard earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute Then she thought consolingly to herself Mine are not like that they are only silly never bad so I won t be worried and taking up her book she said with a studious face Shall we go on Sir I ll be very good and proper now I shall hope so was all he said but he meant more than she imagined and the grave kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead As soon as she went to her room she got out her papers and carefully reread every one of her stories Being a little shortsighted Mr Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses and Jo had tried them once smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book Now she seemed to have on the Professor s mental or moral spectacles also for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay They are trash and will soon be worse trash if I go on for each is more sensational than the last I ve gone blindly on hurting myself and other people for the sake of money I know it s so for I can t read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr Bhaer got hold of them Jo turned hot at the bare idea and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze Yes that s the best place for such inflammable nonsense I d better burn the house down I suppose than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away a little black cinder with fiery eyes But when nothing remained of all her three month s work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap Jo looked sober as she sat on the floor wondering what she ought to do about her wages I think I haven t done much harm yet and may keep this to pay for my time she said after a long meditation adding impatiently I almost wish I hadn t any conscience it s so inconvenient If I didn t care about doing right and didn t feel uncomfortable when doing wrong I should get on capitally I can t help wishing sometimes that Mother and Father hadn t been so particular about such things Ah Jo instead of wishing that thank God that Father and Mother were particular and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood Jo wrote no more sensational stories deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation but going to the other extreme as is the way with people of her stamp she took a course of Mrs Sherwood Miss Edgeworth and Hannah More and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon so intensely moral was it She had her doubts about it from the beginning for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century She sent this didactic gem to several markets but it found no purchaser and she was inclined to agree with Mr Dashwood that morals didn t sell Then she tried a child s story which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief But much as she liked to write for children Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular Sabbath school nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues So nothing came of these trials and Jo corked up her inkstand and said in a fit of very wholesome humility I don t know anything I ll wait until I do before I try again and meantime sweep mud in the street if I can t do better that s honest at least Which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good While these internal revolutions were going on her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer He did it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof but she stood the test and he was satisfied for though no words passed between them he knew that she had given up writing Not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky but she spent her evenings downstairs now was met no more among newspaper offices and studied with a dogged patience which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful if not pleasant He helped her in many ways proving himself a true friend and Jo was happy for while her pen lay idle she was learning other lessons besides German and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life It was a pleasant winter and a long one for she did not leave Mrs Kirke till June Everyone seemed sorry when the time came The children were inconsolable and Mr Bhaer s hair stuck straight up all over his head for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind Going home Ah you are happy that you haf a home to go in he said when she told him and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner while she held a little levee on that last evening She was going early so she bade them all goodbye overnight and when his turn came she said warmly Now Sir you won t forget to come and see us if you ever travel our way will you I ll never forgive you if you do for I want them all to know my friend Do you Shall I come he asked looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see Yes come next month Laurie graduates then and you d enjoy commencement as something new That is your best friend of whom you speak he said in an altered tone Yes my boy Teddy I m very proud of him and should like you to see him Jo looked up then quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another Something in Mr Bhaer s face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a best friend and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter she involuntarily began to blush and the more she tried not to the redder she grew If it had not been for Tina on her knee She didn t know what would have become of her Fortunately the child was moved to hug her so she managed to hide her face an instant hoping the Professor did not see it But he did and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression as he said cordially I fear I shall not make the time for that but I wish the friend much success and you all happiness Gott bless you And with that he shook hands warmly shouldered Tina and went away But after the boys were abed he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the heimweh or homesickness lying heavy at his heart Once when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face he leaned his head on his hands a minute and then roamed about the room as if in search of something that he could not find It is not for me I must not hope it now he said to himself with a sigh that was almost a groan Then as if reproaching himself for the longing that he could not repress he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow took down his seldom used meerschaum and opened his Plato He did his best and did it manfully but I don t think he found that a pair of rampant boys a pipe or even the divine Plato were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home Early as it was he was at the station next morning to see Jo off and thanks to him she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell a bunch of violets to keep her company and best of all the happy thought Well the winter s gone and I ve written no books earned no fortune but I ve made a friend worth having and I ll try to keep him all my life CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE HEARTACHE Whatever his motive might have been Laurie studied to some purpose that year for he graduated with honor and gave the Latin oration with the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes so his friends said They were all there his grandfather oh so proud Mr and Mrs March John and Meg Jo and Beth and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time but fail to win from the world by any after triumphs I ve got to stay for this confounded supper but I shall be home early tomorrow You ll come and meet me as usual girls Laurie said as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over He said girls but he meant Jo for she was the only one who kept up the old custom She had not the heart to refuse her splendid successful boy anything and answered warmly I ll come Teddy rain or shine and march before you playing Hail the conquering hero comes on a jew s harp Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic Oh deary me I know he ll say something and then what shall I do Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears and having decided that she wouldn t be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be she set forth at the appointed time hoping Teddy wouldn t do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings A call at Meg s and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn still further fortified her for the tete a tete but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance she had a strong desire to turn about and run away Where s the jew s harp Jo cried Laurie as soon as he was within speaking distance I forgot it And Jo took heart again for that salutation could not be called lover like She always used to take his arm on these occasions now she did not and he made no complaint which was a bad sign but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove Then he walked more slowly suddenly lost his fine flow of language and now and then a dreadful pause occurred To rescue the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling Jo said hastily Now you must have a good long holiday I intend to Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come and made her put out her hand with an imploring No Teddy Please don t I will and you must hear me It s no use Jo we ve got to have it out and the sooner the better for both of us he answered getting flushed and excited all at once Say what you like then I ll listen said Jo with a desperate sort of patience Laurie was a young lover but he was in earnest and meant to have it out if he died in the attempt so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuousity saying in a voice that would get choky now and then in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady I ve loved you ever since I ve known you Jo couldn t help it you ve been so good to me I ve tried to show it but you wouldn t let me Now I m going to make you hear and give me an answer for I can t go on so any longer I wanted to save you this I thought you d understand began Jo finding it a great deal harder than she expected I know you did but the girls are so queer you never know what they mean They say no when they mean yes and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it returned Laurie entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact I don t I never wanted to make you care for me so and I went away to keep you from it if I could I thought so It was like you but it was no use I only loved you all the more and I worked hard to please you and I gave up billiards and everything you didn t like and waited and never complained for I hoped you d love me though I m not half good enough Here there was a choke that couldn t be controlled so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his confounded throat You you are you re a great deal too good for me and I m so grateful to you and so proud and fond of you I don t know why I can t love you as you want me to I ve tried but I can t change the feeling and it would be a lie to say I do when I don t Really truly Jo He stopped short and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget Really truly dear They were in the grove now close by the stile and when the last words fell reluctantly from Jo s lips Laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on but for once in his life the fence was too much for him So he just laid his head down on the mossy post and stood so still that Jo was frightened Oh Teddy I m sorry so desperately sorry I could kill myself if it would do any good I wish you wouldn t take it so hard I can t help it You know it s impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they don t cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully as she softly patted his shoulder remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago They do sometimes said a muffled voice from the post I don t believe it s the right sort of love and I d rather not try it was the decided answer There was a long pause while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river and the tall grass rustled in the wind Presently Jo said very soberly as she sat down on the step of the stile Laurie I want to tell you something He started as if he had been shot threw up his head and cried out in a fierce tone Don t tell me that Jo I can t bear it now Tell what she asked wondering at his violence That you love that old man What old man demanded Jo thinking he must mean his grandfather That devilish Professor you were always writing about If you say you love him I know I shall do something desperate and he looked as if he would keep his word as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes Jo wanted to laugh but restrained herself and said warmly for she too was getting excited with all this Don t swear Teddy He isn t old nor anything bad but good and kind and the best friend I ve got next to you Pray don t fly into a passion I want to be kind but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor I haven t the least idea of loving him or anybody else But you will after a while and then what will become of me You ll love someone else too like a sensible boy and forget all this trouble I can t love anyone else and I ll never forget you Jo Never Never with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words What shall I do with him sighed Jo finding that emotions were more unmanagable than she expected You haven t heard what I wanted to tell you Sit down and listen for indeed I want to do right and make you happy she said hoping to soothe him with a little reason which proved that she knew nothing about love Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech Laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile and looked up at her with an expectant face Now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo s part for how could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him She gently turned his head away saying as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake how touching that was to be sure I agree with Mother that you and I are not suited to each other because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable if we were so foolish as to Jo paused a little over the last word but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression Marry no we shouldn t If you loved me Jo I should be a perfect saint for you could make me anything you like No I can t I ve tried and failed and I won t risk our happiness by such a serious experiment We don t agree and we never shall so we ll be good friends all our lives but we won t go and do anything rash Yes we will if we get the chance muttered Laurie rebelliously Now do be reasonable and take a sensible view of the case implored Jo almost at her wit s end I won t be reasonable I don t want to take what you call a sensible view It won t help me and it only makes it harder I don t believe you ve got any heart I wish I hadn t There was a little quiver in Jo s voice and thinking it a good omen Laurie turned round bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously wheedlesome before Don t disappoint us dear Everyone expects it Grandpa has set his heart upon it your people like it and I can t get on without you Say you will and let s be happy Do do Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy and never could It was very hard to do but she did it knowing that delay was both useless and cruel I can t say yes truly so I won t say it at all You ll see that I m right by and by and thank me for it she began solemnly I ll be hanged if I do and Laurie bounced up off the grass burning with indignation at the very idea Yes you will persisted Jo You ll get over this after a while and find some lovely accomplished girl who will adore you and make a fine mistress for your fine house I shouldn t I m homely and awkward and odd and old and you d be ashamed of me and we should quarrel we can t help it even now you see and I shouldn t like elegant society and you would and you d hate my scribbling and I couldn t get on without it and we should be unhappy and wish we hadn t done it and everything would be horrid Anything more asked Laurie finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst Nothing more except that I don t believe I shall ever marry I m happy as I am and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man I know better broke in Laurie You think so now but there ll come a time when you will care for somebody and you ll love him tremendously and live and die for him I know you will it s your way and I shall have to stand by and see it and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical if his face had not been so tragic Yes I will live and die for him if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself and you must do the best you can cried Jo losing patience with poor Teddy I ve done my best but you won t be reasonable and it s selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can t give I shall always be fond of you very fond indeed as a friend but I ll never marry you and the sooner you believe it the better for both of us so now That speech was like gunpowder Laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself then turned sharply away saying in a desperate sort of tone You ll be sorry some day Jo Oh where are you going she cried for his face frightened her To the devil was the consoling answer For a minute Jo s heart stood still as he swung himself down the bank toward the river but it takes much folly sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death and Laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure He had no thought of a melodramatic plunge but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat and row away with all his might making better time up the river than he had done in any race Jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart That will do him good and he ll come home in such a tender penitent state of mind that I shan t dare to see him she said adding as she went slowly home feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing and buried it under the leaves Now I must go and prepare Mr Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy I wish he d love Beth perhaps he may in time but I begin to think I was mistaken about her Oh dear How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them I think it s dreadful Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself she went straight to Mr Laurence told the hard story bravely through and then broke down crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old gentleman though sorely disappointed did not utter a reproach He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie and hoped she would change her mind but he knew even better than Jo that love cannot be forced so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harm s way for Young Impetuosity s parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess When Laurie came home dead tired but quite composed his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing and kept up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two But when they sat together in the twilight the time they used to enjoy so much it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of the last year s success which to him now seemed like love s labor lost He bore it as long as he could then went to his piano and began to play The windows were open and Jo walking in the garden with Beth for once understood music better than her sister for he played the Sonata Pathetique and played it as he never did before That s very fine I dare say but it s sad enough to make one cry Give us something gayer lad said Mr Laurence whose kind old heart was full of sympathy which he longed to show but knew not how Laurie dashed into a livelier strain played stormily for several minutes and would have got through bravely if in a momentary lull Mrs March s voice had not been heard calling Jo dear come in I want you Just what Laurie longed to say with a different meaning As he listened he lost his place the music ended with a broken chord and the musician sat silent in the dark I can t stand this muttered the old gentleman Up he got groped his way to the piano laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders and said as gently as a woman I know my boy I know No answer for an instant then Laurie asked sharply Who told you Jo herself Then there s an end of it And he shook off his grandfather s hands with an impatient motion for though grateful for the sympathy his man s pride could not bear a man s pity Not quite I want to say one thing and then there shall be an end of it returned Mr Laurence with unusual mildness You won t care to stay at home now perhaps I don t intend to run away from a girl Jo can t prevent my seeing her and I shall stay and do it as long as I like interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone Not if you are the gentleman I think you I m disappointed but the girl can t help it and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time Where will you go Anywhere I don t care what becomes of me and Laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather s ear Take it like a man and don t do anything rash for God s sake Why not go abroad as you planned and forget it I can t But you ve been wild to go and I promised you should when you got through college Ah but I didn t mean to go alone and Laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see I don t ask you to go alone There s someone ready and glad to go with you anywhere in the world Who Sir stopping to listen Myself Laurie came back as quickly as he went and put out his hand saying huskily I m a selfish brute but you know Grandfather Lord help me yes I do know for I ve been through it all before once in my own young days and then with your father Now my dear boy just sit quietly down and hear my plan It s all settled and can be carried out at once said Mr Laurence keeping hold of the young man as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before him Well sir what is it and Laurie sat down without a sign of interest in face or voice There is business in London that needs looking after I meant you should attend to it but I can do it better myself and things here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them My partners do almost everything I m merely holding on until you take my place and can be off at any time But you hate traveling Sir I can t ask it of you at your age began Laurie who was grateful for the sacrifice but much preferred to go alone if he went at all The old gentleman knew that perfectly well and particularly desired to prevent it for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices So stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him he said stoutly Bless your soul I m not superannuated yet I quite enjoy the idea It will do me good and my old bones won t suffer for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy or that he did not like the plan and made the old man add hastily I don t mean to be a marplot or a burden I go because I think you d feel happier than if I was left behind I don t intend to gad about with you but leave you free to go where you like while I amuse myself in my own way I ve friends in London and Paris and should like to visit them Meantime you can go to Italy Germany Switzerland where you will and enjoy pictures music scenery and adventures to your heart s content Now Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence the broken heart gave an unexpected leap and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness He sighed and then said in a spiritless tone Just as you like Sir It doesn t matter where I go or what I do It does to me remember that my lad I give you entire liberty but I trust you to make an honest use of it Promise me that Laurie Anything you like Sir Good thought the old gentleman You don t care now but there ll come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief or I m much mistaken Being an energetic individual Mr Laurence struck while the iron was hot and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel they were off During the time necessary for preparation Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases He was moody irritable and pensive by turns lost his appetite neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano avoided Jo but consoled himself by staring at her from his window with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day Unlike some sufferers he never spoke of his unrequited passion and would allow no one not even Mrs March to attempt consolation or offer sympathy On some accounts this was a relief to his friends but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable and everyone rejoiced that the poor dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble and come home happy Of course he smiled darkly at their delusion but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable When the parting came he affected high spirits to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves This gaiety did not impose upon anybody but they tried to look as if it did for his sake and he got on very well till Mrs March kissed him with a whisper full of motherly solicitude Then feeling that he was going very fast he hastily embraced them all round not forgetting the afflicted Hannah and ran downstairs as if for his life Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round He did look round came back put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic Oh Jo can t you Teddy dear I wish I could That was all except a little pause Then Laurie straightened himself up said It s all right never mind and went away without another word Ah but it wasn t all right and Jo did mind for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend and when he left her without a look behind him she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again CHAPTER THIRTY SIX BETH S SECRET When Jo came home that spring she had been struck with the change in Beth No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily but to eyes sharpened by absence it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo s heart as she saw her sister s face It was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn yet there was a strange transparent look about it as if the mortal was being slowly refined away and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty Jo saw and felt it but said nothing at the time and soon the first impression lost much of its power for Beth seemed happy no one appeared to doubt that she was better and presently in other cares Jo for a time forgot her fear But when Laurie was gone and peace prevailed again the vague anxiety returned and haunted her She had confessed her sins and been forgiven but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip Beth had thanked her heartily but begged not to go so far away from home Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better and as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies Jo took Beth down to the quiet place where she could live much in the open air and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks It was not a fashionable place but even among the pleasant people there the girls made few friends preferring to live for one another Beth was too shy to enjoy society and Jo too wrapped up in her to care for anyone else So they were all in all to each other and came and went quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about them who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one always together as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away They did feel it yet neither spoke of it for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and Beth s but when she put out her hand to lift it up there seemed something sacred in the silence and she waited for Beth to speak She wondered and was thankful also that her parents did not seem to see what she saw and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her she said nothing of it to those at home believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better She wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo s lap while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet One day Beth told her Jo thought she was asleep she lay so still and putting down her book sat looking at her with wistful eyes trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth s cheeks But she could not find enough to satisfy her for the cheeks were very thin and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was slowly drifting away from her and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing and when they cleared Beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say Jo dear I m glad you know it I ve tried to tell you but I couldn t There was no answer except her sister s cheek against her own not even tears for when most deeply moved Jo did not cry She was the weaker then and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear I ve known it for a good while dear and now I m used to it it isn t hard to think of or to bear Try to see it so and don t be troubled about me because it s best indeed it is Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn Beth You did not feel it then and keep it to yourself so long did you asked Jo refusing to see or say that it was best but glad to know that Laurie had no part in Beth s trouble Yes I gave up hoping then but I didn t like to own it I tried to think it was a sick fancy and would not let it trouble anyone But when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans it was hard to feel that I could never be like you and then I was miserable Jo Oh Beth and you didn t tell me didn t let me comfort and help you How could you shut me out bear it all alone Jo s voice was full of tender reproach and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say goodbye to health love and life and take up her cross so cheerfully Perhaps it was wrong but I tried to do right I wasn t sure no one said anything and I hoped I was mistaken It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg and Amy away and you so happy with Laurie at least I thought so then And I thought you loved him Beth and I went away because I couldn t cried Jo glad to say all the truth Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain and added softly Then you didn t dearie I was afraid it was so and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while Why Jo how could I when he was so fond of you asked Beth as innocently as a child I do love him dearly He is so good to me how can I help It But he could never be anything to me but my brother I hope he truly will be sometime Not through me said Jo decidedly Amy is left for him and they would suit excellently but I have no heart for such things now I don t care what becomes of anybody but you Beth You must get well I want to oh so much I try but every day I lose a little and feel more sure that I shall never gain it back It s like the tide Jo when it turns it goes slowly but it can t be stopped It shall be stopped your tide must not turn so soon nineteen is too young Beth I can t let you go I ll work and pray and fight against it I ll keep you in spite of everything There must be ways it can t be too late God won t be so cruel as to take you from me cried poor Jo rebelliously for her spirit was far less piously submissive than Beth s Simple sincere people seldom speak much of their piety It shows itself in acts rather than in words and has more influence than homilies or protestations Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life and cheerfully wait for death Like a confiding child she asked no questions but left everything to God and nature Father and Mother of us all feeling sure that they and they only could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches only loved her better for her passionate affection and clung more closely to the dear human love from which our Father never means us to be weaned but through which He draws us closer to Himself She could not say I m glad to go for life was very sweet for her She could only sob out I try to be willing while she held fast to Jo as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together By and by Beth said with recovered serenity You ll tell them this when we go home I think they will see it without words sighed Jo for now it seemed to her that Beth changed every day Perhaps not I ve heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things If they don t see it you will tell them for me I don t want any secrets and it s kinder to prepare them Meg has John and the babies to comfort her but you must stand by Father and Mother won t you Jo If I can But Beth I don t give up yet I m going to believe that it is a sick fancy and not let you think it s true said Jo trying to speak cheerfully Beth lay a minute thinking and then said in her quiet way I don t know how to express myself and shouldn t try to anyone but you because I can t speak out except to my Jo I only mean to say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long I m not like the rest of you I never made any plans about what I d do when I grew up I never thought of being married as you all did I couldn t seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth trotting about at home of no use anywhere but there I never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all I m not afraid but it seems as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven Jo could not speak and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide A white winged gull flew by with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast Beth watched it till it vanished and her eyes were full of sadness A little gray coated sand bird came tripping over the beach peeping softly to itself as if enjoying the sun and sea It came quite close to Beth and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone dressing its wet feathers quite at home Beth smiled and felt comforted for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed Dear little bird See Jo how tame it is I like peeps better than the gulls They are not so wild and handsome but they seem happy confiding little things I used to call them my birds last summer and Mother said they reminded her of me busy quaker colored creatures always near the shore and always chirping that contented little song of theirs You are the gull Jo strong and wild fond of the storm and the wind flying far out to sea and happy all alone Meg is the turtledove and Amy is like the lark she writes about trying to get up among the clouds but always dropping down into its nest again Dear little girl She s so ambitious but her heart is good and tender and no matter how high she flies she never will forget home I hope I shall see her again but she seems so far away She is coming in the spring and I mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her I m going to have you well and rosy by that time began Jo feeling that of all the changes in Beth the talking change was the greatest for it seemed to cost no effort now and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth Jo dear don t hope any more It won t do any good I m sure of that We won t be miserable but enjoy being together while we wait We ll have happy times for I don t suffer much and I think the tide will go out easily if you help me Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face and with that silent kiss she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth She was right There was no need of any words when they got home for Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing Tired with her short journey Beth went at once to bed saying how glad she was to be home and when Jo went down she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth s secret Her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help and Jo went to comfort her without a word CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN NEW IMPRESSIONS At three o clock in the afternoon all the fashionable world at Nice may be seen on the Promenade des
