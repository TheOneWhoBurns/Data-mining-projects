teroom filling the baskets she took up her pet production a little book the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet blue and gold with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers were the words Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I ought but I don t thought Amy as her eye went from the bright page to May s discontented face behind the big vases that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled Amy stood a minute turning the leaves in her hand reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street school office or home Even a fair table may become a pulpit if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season Amy s conscience preached her a little sermon from that text then and there and she did what many of us do not always do took the sermon to heart and straightway put it in practice A group of girls were standing about May s table admiring the pretty things and talking over the change of saleswomen They dropped their voices but Amy knew they were speaking of her hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly It was not pleasant but a better spirit had come over her and presently a chance offered for proving it She heard May say sorrowfully It s too bad for there is no time to make other things and I don t want to fill up with odds and ends The table was just complete then Now it s spoiled I dare say she d put them back if you asked her suggested someone How could I after all the fuss began May but she did not finish for Amy s voice came across the hall saying pleasantly You may have them and welcome without asking if you want them I was just thinking I d offer to put them back for they belong to your table rather than mine Here they are please take them and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night As she spoke Amy returned her contribution with a nod and a smile and hurried away again feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it Now I call that lovely of her don t you cried one girl May s answer was inaudible but another young lady whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade added with a disagreeable laugh Very lovely for she knew she wouldn t sell them at her own table Now that was hard When we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated at least and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it feeling that virtue was not always its own reward But it is as she presently discovered for her spirits began to rise and her table to blossom under her skillful hands the girls were very kind and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy as she sat behind her table often quite alone for the little girls deserted very soon Few cared to buy flowers in summer and her bouquets began to droop long before night The art table was the most attractive in the room There was a crowd about it all day long and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes Amy often looked wistfully across longing to be there where she felt at home and happy instead of in a corner with nothing to do It might seem no hardship to some of us but to a pretty blithe young girl it was not only tedious but very trying and the thought of Laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom She did not go home till night and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one though she made no complaint and did not even tell what she had done Her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea Beth helped her dress and made a charming little wreath for her hair while Jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned Don t do anything rude pray Jo I won t have any fuss made so let it all pass and behave yourself begged Amy as she departed early hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one I know and to keep them in your corner as long as possible Teddy and his boys will lend a hand and we ll have a good time yet returned Jo leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie Presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk and she ran out to meet him Is that my boy As sure as this is my girl and Laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified Oh Teddy such doings and Jo told Amy s wrongs with sisterly zeal A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by and by and I ll be hanged if I don t make them buy every flower she s got and camp down before her table afterward said Laurie espousing her cause with warmth The flowers are not at all nice Amy says and the fresh ones may not arrive in time I don t wish to be unjust or suspicious but I shouldn t wonder if they never came at all When people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another observed Jo in a disgusted tone Didn t Hayes give you the best out of our gardens I told him to I didn t know that he forgot I suppose and as your grandpa was poorly I didn t like to worry him by asking though I did want some Now Jo how could you think there was any need of asking They are just as much yours as mine Don t we always go halves in everything began Laurie in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny Gracious I hope not Half of some of your things wouldn t suit me at all But we mustn t stand philandering here I ve got to help Amy so you go and make yourself splendid and if you ll be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall I ll bless you forever Couldn t you do it now asked Laurie so suggestively that Jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste and called through the bars Go away Teddy I m busy Thanks to the conspirators the tables were turned that night for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers with a lovely basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece Then the March family turned out en masse and Jo exerted herself to some purpose for people not only came but stayed laughing at her nonsense admiring Amy s taste and apparently enjoying themselves very much Laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach bought up the bouquets encamped before the table and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room Amy was in her element now and out of gratitude if nothing more was as spritely and gracious as possible coming to the conclusion about that time that virtue was its own reward after all Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety and when Amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor Jo circulated about the Hall picking up various bits of gossip which enlightened her upon the subject of the Chester change of base She reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible She also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning and considered her a model of magnanimity As she passed the art table she glanced over it for her sister s things but saw no sign of them Tucked away out of sight I dare say thought Jo who could forgive her own wrongs but hotly resented any insult offered her family Good evening Miss Jo How does Amy get on asked May with a conciliatory air for she wanted to show that she also could be generous She has sold everything she had that was worth selling and now she is enjoying herself The flower table is always attractive you know especially to gentlemen Jo couldn t resist giving that little slap but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after and fell to praising the great vases which still remained unsold Is Amy s illumination anywhere about I took a fancy to buy that for Father said Jo very anxious to learn the fate of her sister s work Everything of Amy s sold long ago I took care that the right people saw them and they made a nice little sum of money for us returned May who had overcome sundry small temptations as well as Amy had that day Much gratified Jo rushed back to tell the good news and Amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of May s word and manner Now gentlemen I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine especially the art table she said ordering out Teddy s own as the girls called the college friends Charge Chester charge is the motto for that table but do your duty like men and you ll get your money s worth of art in every sense of the word said the irrepressible Jo as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field To hear is to obey but March is fairer far than May said little Parker making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender and getting promptly quenched by Laurie who said Very well my son for a small boy and walked him off with a paternal pat on the head Buy the vases whispered Amy to Laurie as a final heaping of coals of fire on her enemy s head To May s great delight Mr Laurence not only bought the vases but pervaded the hall with one under each arm The other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles and wandered helplessly about afterward burdened with wax flowers painted fans filigree portfolios and other useful and appropriate purchases Aunt Carrol was there heard the story looked pleased and said something to Mrs March in a corner which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later The fair was pronounced a success and when May bade Amy goodnight she did not gush as usual but gave her an affectionate kiss and a look which said forgive and forget That satisfied Amy and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each The reward of merit for a magnanimous March as Laurie announced with a flourish You ve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than I ever gave you credit for Amy You ve behaved sweetly and I respect you with all my heart said Jo warmly as they brushed their hair together late that night Yes we all do and love her for being so ready to forgive It must have been dreadfully hard after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things I don t believe I could have done it as kindly as you did added Beth from her pillow Why girls you needn t praise me so I only did as I d be done by You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady but I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners and I try to do it as far as I know how I can t explain exactly but I want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women I m far from it now but I do my best and hope in time to be what Mother is Amy spoke earnestly and Jo said with a cordial hug I understand now what you mean and I ll never laugh at you again You are getting on faster than you think and I ll take lessons of you in true politeness for you ve learned the secret I believe Try away deary you ll get your reward some day and no one will be more delighted than I shall A week later Amy did get her reward and poor Jo found it hard to be delighted A letter came from Aunt Carrol and Mrs March s face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth who were with her demanded what the glad tidings were Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month and wants Me to go with her burst in Jo flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture No dear not you It s Amy Oh Mother She s too young it s my turn first I ve wanted it so long It would do me so much good and be so altogether splendid I must go I m afraid it s impossible Jo Aunt says Amy decidedly and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor It s always so Amy has all the fun and I have all the work It isn t fair oh it isn t fair cried Jo passionately I m afraid it s partly your own fault dear When Aunt spoke to me the other day she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit and here she writes as if quoting something you had said I planned at first to ask Jo but as favors burden her and she hates French I think I won t venture to invite her Amy is more docile will make a good companion for Flo and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her Oh my tongue my abominable tongue Why can t I learn to keep it quiet groaned Jo remembering words which had been her undoing When she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases Mrs March said sorrowfully I wish you could have gone but there is no hope of it this time so try to bear it cheerfully and don t sadden Amy s pleasure by reproaches or regrets I ll try said Jo winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset I ll take a leaf out of her book and try not only to seem glad but to be so and not grudge her one minute of happiness But it won t be easy for it is a dreadful disappointment and poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears Jo dear I m very selfish but I couldn t spare you and I m glad you are not going quite yet whispered Beth embracing her basket and all with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor and see how gratefully she would bear it By the time Amy came in Jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation not quite as heartily as usual perhaps but without repinings at Amy s good fortune The young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy went about in a solemn sort of rapture and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening leaving such trifles as clothes money and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself It isn t a mere pleasure trip to me girls she said impressively as she scraped her best palette It will decide my career for if I have any genius I shall find it out in Rome and will do something to prove it Suppose you haven t said Jo sewing away with red eyes at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living replied the aspirant for fame with philosophic composure But she made a wry face at the prospect and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes No you won t You hate hard work and you ll marry some rich man and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days said Jo Your predictions sometimes come to pass but I don t believe that one will I m sure I wish it would for if I can t be an artist myself I should like to be able to help those who are said Amy smiling as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawing teacher Hum said Jo with a sigh If you wish it you ll have it for your wishes are always granted mine never Would you like to go asked Amy thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife Rather Well in a year or two I ll send for you and we ll dig in the Forum for relics and carry out all the plans we ve made so many times Thank you I ll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes if it ever does returned Jo accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could There was not much time for preparation and the house was in a ferment till Amy was off Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished when she retired to her refuge the garret and cried till she couldn t cry any more Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best and she clung to Laurie the last lingerer saying with a sob Oh take care of them for me and if anything should happen I will dear I will and if anything happens I ll come and comfort you whispered Laurie little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word So Amy sailed away to find the Old World which is always new and beautiful to young eyes while her father and friend watched her from the shore fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the happy hearted girl who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea CHAPTER THIRTY ONE OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT London Dearest People Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel Piccadilly It s not a fashionable place but Uncle stopped here years ago and won t go anywhere else However we don t mean to stay long so it s no great matter Oh I can t begin to tell you how I enjoy it all I never can so I ll only give you bits out of my notebook for I ve done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started I sent a line from Halifax when I felt pretty miserable but after that I got on delightfully seldom ill on deck all day with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me Everyone was very kind to me especially the officers Don t laugh Jo gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship to hold on to or to wait upon one and as they have nothing to do it s a mercy to make them useful otherwise they would smoke themselves to death I m afraid Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way and liked to be let alone so when I had done what I could for them I went and enjoyed myself Such walks on deck such sunsets such splendid air and waves It was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse when we went rushing on so grandly I wish Beth could have come it would have done her so much good As for Jo she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib or whatever the high thing is called made friends with the engineers and tooted on the captain s speaking trumpet she d have been in such a state of rapture It was all heavenly but I was glad to see the Irish coast and found it very lovely so green and sunny with brown cabins here and there ruins on some of the hills and gentlemen s countryseats in the valleys with deer feeding in the parks It was early in the morning but I didn t regret getting up to see it for the bay was full of little boats the shore so picturesque and a rosy sky overhead I never shall forget it At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us Mr Lennox and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney he sighed and sung with a look at me Oh have you e er heard of Kate Kearney She lives on the banks of Killarney From the glance of her eye Shun danger and fly For fatal s the glance of Kate Kearney Wasn t that nonsensical We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours It s a dirty noisy place and I was glad to leave it Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves some ugly thick shoes and an umbrella and got shaved la mutton chop the first thing Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes the little bootblack knew that an American stood in them and said with a grin There yer har sir I ve given em the latest Yankee shine It amused Uncle immensely Oh I must tell you what that absurd Lennox did He got his friend Ward who came on with us to order a bouquet for me and the first thing I saw in my room was a lovely one with Robert Lennox s compliments on the card Wasn t that fun girls I like traveling I never shall get to London if I don t hurry The trip was like riding through a long picture gallery full of lovely landscapes The farmhouses were my delight with thatched roofs ivy up to the eaves latticed windows and stout women with rosy children at the doors The very cattle looked more tranquil than ours as they stood knee deep in clover and the hens had a contented cluck as if they never got nervous like Yankee biddies Such perfect color I never saw the grass so green sky so blue grain so yellow woods so dark I was in a rapture all the way So was Flo and we kept bouncing from one side to the other trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour Aunt was tired and went to sleep but Uncle read his guidebook and wouldn t be astonished at anything This is the way we went on Amy flying up Oh that must be Kenilworth that gray place among the trees Flo darting to my window How sweet We must go there sometime won t we Papa Uncle calmly admiring his boots No my dear not unless you want beer that s a brewery A pause then Flo cried out Bless me there s a gallows and a man going up Where where shrieks Amy staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains A colliery remarks Uncle with a twinkle of the eye Here s a lovely flock of lambs all lying down says Amy See Papa aren t they pretty added Flo sentimentally Geese young ladies returns Uncle in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy the Flirtations of Captain Cavendish and I have the scenery all to myself Of course it rained when we got to London and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas We rested unpacked and shopped a little between the showers Aunt Mary got me some new things for I came off in such a hurry I wasn t half ready A white hat and blue feather a muslin dress to match and the loveliest mantle you ever saw Shopping in Regent Street is perfectly splendid Things seem so cheap nice ribbons only sixpence a yard I laid in a stock but shall get my gloves in Paris Doesn t that sound sort of elegant and rich Flo and I for the fun of it ordered a hansom cab while Aunt and Uncle were out and went for a drive though we learned afterward that it wasn t the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone It was so droll For when we were shut in by the wooden apron the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened and told me to stop him but he was up outside behind somewhere and I couldn t get at him He didn t hear me call nor see me flap my parasol in front and there we were quite helpless rattling away and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace At last in my despair I saw a little door in the roof and on poking it open a red eye appeared and a beery voice said Now then mum I gave my order as soberly as I could and slamming down the door with an Aye aye mum the man made his horse walk as if going to a funeral I poked again and said A little faster then off he went helter skelter as before and we resigned ourselves to our fate Today was fair and we went to Hyde Park close by for we are more aristocratic than we look The Duke of Devonshire lives near I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate and the Duke of Wellington s house is not far off Such sights as I saw my dear It was as good as Punch for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats up behind and powdered coachmen in front Smart maids with the rosiest children I ever saw handsome girls looking half asleep dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about and tall soldiers in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side looking so funny I longed to sketch them Rotten Row means Route de Roi or the king s way but now it s more like a riding school than anything else The horses are splendid and the men especially the grooms ride well but the women are stiff and bounce which isn t according to our rules I longed to show them a tearing American gallop for they trotted solemnly up and down in their scant habits and high hats looking like the women in a toy Noah s Ark Everyone rides old men stout ladies little children and the young folks do a deal of flirting here I saw a pair exchange rose buds for it s the thing to wear one in the button hole and I thought it rather a nice little idea In the P M to Westminster Abbey but don t expect me to describe it that s impossible so I ll only say it was sublime This evening we are going to see Fechter which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life It s very late but I can t let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening Who do you think came in as we were at tea Laurie s English friends Fred and Frank Vaughn I was so surprised for I shouldn t have known them but for the cards Both are tall fellows with whiskers Fred handsome in the English style and Frank much better for he only limps slightly and uses no crutches They had heard from Laurie where we were to be and came to ask us to their house but Uncle won t go so we shall return the call and see them as we can They went to the theater with us and we did have such a good time for Frank devoted himself to Flo and Fred and I talked over past present and future fun as if we had known each other all our days Tell Beth Frank asked for her and was sorry to hear of her ill health Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo and sent his respectful compliments to the big hat Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence or the fun we had there What ages ago it seems doesn t it Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time so I must stop I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady writing here so late with my room full of pretty things and my head a jumble of parks theaters new gowns and gallant creatures who say Ah and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English lordliness I long to see you all and in spite of my nonsense am as ever your loving AMY PARIS Dear girls In my last I told you about our London visit how kind the Vaughns were and what pleasant parties they made for us I enjoyed the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else for at Hampton I saw Raphael s cartoons and at the Museum rooms full of pictures by Turner Lawrence Reynolds Hogarth and the other great creatures The day in Richmond Park was charming for we had a regular English picnic and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I could copy also heard a nightingale and saw larks go up We did London to our heart s content thanks to Fred and Frank and were sorry to go away for though English people are slow to take you in when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality I think The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don t for Grace and I are great friends and the boys very nice fellows especially Fred Well we were hardly settled here when he turned up again saying he had come for a holiday and was going to Switzerland Aunt looked sober at first but he was so cool about it she couldn t say a word And now we get on nicely and are very glad he came for he speaks French like a native and I don t know what we should do without him Uncle doesn t know ten words and insists on talking English very loud as if it would make people understand him Aunt s pronunciation is old fashioned and Flo and I though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal find we don t and are very grateful to have Fred do the parley vooing as Uncle calls it Such delightful times as we are having Sight seeing from morning till night stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures Rainy days I spend in the Louvre revelling in pictures Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest because she has no soul for art but I have and I m cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can She would like the relics of great people better for I ve seen her Napoleon s cocked hat and gray coat his baby s cradle and his old toothbrush also Marie Antoinette s little shoe the ring of Saint Denis Charlemagne s sword and many other interesting things I ll talk for hours about them when I come but haven t time to write The Palais Royale is a heavenly place so full of bijouterie and lovely things that I m nearly distracted because I can t buy them Fred wanted to get me some but of course I didn t allow it Then the Bois and Champs Elysees are tres magnifique I ve seen the imperial family several times the emperor an ugly hard looking man the empress pale and pretty but dressed in bad taste I thought purple dress green hat and yellow gloves Little Nap is a handsome boy who sits chatting to his tutor and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his four horse barouche with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens for they are lovely though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better Pere la Chaise is very curious for many of the tombs are like small rooms and looking in one sees a table with images or pictures of the dead and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament That is so Frenchy Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli and sitting on the balcony we look up and down the long brilliant street It is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our day s work to go out Fred is very entertaining and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever knew except Laurie whose manners are more charming I wish Fred was dark for I don t fancy light men however the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family so I won t find fault with their yellow hair as my own is yellower Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland and as we shall travel fast I shall only be able to give you hasty letters I keep my diary and try to remember correctly and describe clearly all that I see and admire as Father advised It is good practice for me and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles Adieu I embrace you tenderly Votre Amie HEIDELBERG My dear Mamma Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne I ll try to tell you what has happened for some of it is very important as you will see The sail up the Rhine was perfect and I just sat and enjoyed it with all my might Get Father s old guidebooks and read about it I haven t words beautiful enough to describe it At Coblentz we had a lovely time for some students from Bonn with whom Fred got acquainted on the boat gave us a serenade It was a moonlight night and about one o clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our windows We flew up and hid behind the curtains but sly peeps showed us Fred and the students singing away down below It was the most romantic thing I ever saw the river the bridge of boats the great fortress opposite moonlight everywhere and music fit to melt a heart of stone When they were done we threw down some flowers and saw them scramble for them kiss their hands to the invisible ladies and go laughing away to smoke and drink beer I suppose Next morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket and looked very sentimental I laughed at him and said I didn t throw it but Flo which seemed to disgust him for he tossed it out of the window and turned sensible again I m afraid I m going to have trouble with that boy it begins to look like it The baths at Nassau were very gay so was Baden Baden where Fred lost some money and I scolded him He needs someone to look after him when Frank is not with him Kate said once she hoped he d marry soon and I quite agree with her that it would be well for him Frankfurt was delightful I saw Goethe s house Schiller s statue and Dannecker s famous Ariadne It was very lovely but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the story better I didn t like to ask as everyone knew it or pretended they did I wish Jo would tell me all about it I ought to have read more for I find I don t know anything and it mortifies me Now comes the serious part for it happened here and Fred has just gone He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night Since then I ve begun to feel that the moonlight walks balcony talks and daily adventures were something more to him than fun I haven t flirted Mother truly but remembered what you said to me and have done my very best I can t help it if people like me I don t try to make them and it worries me if I don t care for them though Jo says I haven t got any heart Now I know Mother will shake her head and the girls say Oh the mercenary little wretch but I ve made up my mind and if Fred asks me I shall accept him though I m not madly in love I like him and we get on comfortably together He is handsome young clever enough and very rich ever so much richer than the Laurences I don t think his family would object and I should be very happy for they are all kind well bred generous people and they like me Fred as the eldest twin will have the estate I suppose and such a splendid one it is A city house in a fashionable street not so showy as our big houses but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury such as English people believe in I like it for it s genuine I ve seen the plate the family jewels the old servants and pictures of the country place with its park great house lovely grounds and fine horses Oh it would be all I should ask And I d rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily and find nothing behind I may be mercenary but I hate poverty and don t mean to bear it a minute longer than I can help One of us must marry well Meg didn t Jo won t Beth can t yet so I shall and make everything okay all round I wouldn t marry a man I hated or despised You may be sure of that and though Fred is not my model hero he does very well and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me and let me do just as I liked So I ve been turning the matter over in my mind the last week for it was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me He said nothing but little things showed it He never goes with Flo always gets on my side of the carriage table or promenade looks sentimental when we are alone and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me Yesterday at dinner when an Austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend a rakish looking baron about ein wonderschones Blondchen Fred looked as fierce as a lion and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate He isn t one of the cool stiff Englishmen but is rather peppery for he has Scotch blood in him as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes Well last evening we went up to the castle about sunset at least all of us but Fred who was to meet us there after going to the Post Restante for letters We had a charming time poking about the ruins the vaults where the monster tun is and the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his English wife I liked the great terrace best for the view was divine so while the rest went to see the rooms inside I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion s head on the wall with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it I felt as if I d got into a romance sitting there watching the Neckar rolling through the valley listening to the music of the Austrian band below and waiting for my lover like a real storybook girl I had a feeling that something was going to happen and I was ready for it I didn t feel blushy or quakey but quite cool and only a little excited By and by I heard Fred s voice and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me He looked so troubled that I forgot all about myself and asked what the matter was He said he d just got a letter begging him to come home for Frank was very ill So he was going at once on the night train and only had time to say good by I was very sorry for him and disappointed for myself but only for a minute because he said as he shook hands and said it in a way that I could not mistake I shall soon come back you won t forget me Amy I didn t promise but I looked at him and he seemed satisfied and there was no time for anything but messages and good byes for he was off in an hour and we all miss him very much I know he wanted to speak but I think from something he once hinted that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while for he is a rash boy and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter in law We shall soon meet in Rome and then if I don t change my mind I ll say Yes thank you when he says Will you please Of course this is all very private but I wished you to know what was going on Don t be anxious about me remember I am your prudent Amy and be sure I will do nothing rashly Send me as much advice as you like I ll use it if I can I wish I could see you for a good talk Marmee Love and trust me Ever your AMY CHAPTER THIRTY TWO TENDER TROUBLES Jo I m anxious about Beth Why Mother she has seemed unusually well since the babies came It s not her health that troubles me now it s her spirits I m sure there is something on her mind and I want you to discover what it is What makes you think so Mother She sits alone a good deal and doesn t talk to her father as much as she used I found her crying over the babies the other day When she sings the songs are always sad ones and now and then I see a look in her face that I don t understand This isn t like Beth and it worries me Have you asked her about it I have tried once or twice but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that I stopped I never force my children s confidence and I seldom have to wait for long Mrs March glanced at Jo as she spoke but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth s and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute Jo said I think she is growing up and so begins to dream dreams and have hopes and fears and fidgets without knowing why or being able to explain them Why Mother Beth s eighteen but we don t realize it and treat her like a child forgetting she s a woman So she is Dear heart how fast you do grow up returned her mother with a sigh and a smile Can t be helped Marmee so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries and let your birds hop out of the nest one by one I promise never to hop very far if that is any comfort to you It s a great comfort Jo I always feel strong when you are at home now Meg is gone Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon but when the tug comes you are always ready Why you know I don t mind hard jobs much and there must always be one scrub in a family Amy is splendid in fine works and I m not but I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up or half the family fall sick at once Amy is distinguishing herself abroad but if anything is amiss at home I m your man I leave Beth to your hands then for she will open her tender little heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else Be very kind and don t let her think anyone watches or talks about her If she only would get quite strong and cheerful again I shouldn t have a wish in the world Happy woman I ve got heaps My dear what are they I ll settle Bethy s troubles and then I ll tell you mine They are not very wearing so they ll keep and Jo stitched away with a wise nod which set her mother s heart at rest about her for the present at least While apparently absorbed in her own affairs Jo watched Beth and after many conflicting conjectures finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her A slight incident gave Jo the clue to the mystery she thought and lively fancy loving heart did the rest She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon when she and Beth were alone together Yet as she scribbled she kept her eye on her sister who seemed unusually quiet Sitting at the window Beth s work often dropped into her lap and she leaned her head upon her hand in a dejected attitude while her eyes rested on the dull autumnal landscape Suddenly some one passed below whistling like an operatic blackbird and a voice called out All serene Coming in tonight Beth started leaned forward smiled and nodded watched the passer by till his quick tramp died away then said softly as if to herself How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks Hum said Jo still intent upon her sister s face for the bright color faded as quickly as it came the smile vanished and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge Beth whisked it off and in her half averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill Fearing to betray herself she slipped away murmuring something about needing more paper Mercy on me Beth loves Laurie she said sitting down in her own room pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made I never dreamed of such a thing What will Mother say I wonder if her there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought If he shouldn t love back again how dreadful it would be He must I ll make him and she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous looking boy laughing at her from the wall Oh dear we are growing up with a vengeance Here s Meg married and a mamma Amy flourishing away at Paris and Beth in love I m the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief Jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said with a decided nod at the face opposite No thank you sir you re very charming but you ve no more stability than a weathercock So you needn t write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way for it won t do a bit of good and I won t have it Then she sighed and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations which only confirmed her suspicion Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked with Jo his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle but so was everybody s Therefore no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others Indeed a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that our boy was getting fonder than ever of Jo who however wouldn t hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it If they had known the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying I told you so But Jo hated philandering and wouldn t allow it always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger When Laurie first went to college he fell in love about once a month but these small flames were as brief as ardent did no damage and much amused Jo who took great interest in the alternations of hope despair and resignation which were confided to her in their weekly conferences But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines hinted darkly at one all absorbing passion and indulged occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom Then he avoided the tender subject altogether wrote philosophical notes to Jo turned studious and gave out that he was going to dig intending to graduate in a blaze of glory This suited the young lady better than twilight confidences tender pressures of the hand and eloquent glances of the eye for with Jo brain developed earlier than heart and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones because when tired of them the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for and the latter were less manageable Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done before If she had not got the new idea into her head she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that Beth was very quiet and Laurie very kind to her But having given the rein to her lively fancy it galloped away with her at a great pace and common sense being rather weakened by a long course of romance writing did not come to the rescue As usual Beth lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by amusing her with all sorts of gossip for she depended on her weekly spin and he never disappointed her But that evening Jo fancied that Beth s eyes rested on the lively dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match though the phrases caught off a tice stumped off his ground and the leg hit for three were as intelligible to her as Sanskrit She also fancied having set her heart upon seeing it that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie s manner that he dropped his voice now and then laughed less than usual was a little absent minded and settled the afghan over Beth s feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender Who knows Stranger things have happened thought Jo as she fussed about the room She will make quite an angel of him and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear if they only love each other I don t see how he can help it and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way As everyone was out of the way but herself Jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed But where should she go And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion she sat down to settle that point Now the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa long broad well cushioned and low a trifle shabby as well it might be for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies fished over the back rode on the arms and had menageries under it as children and rested tired heads dreamed dreams and listened to tender talk on it as young women They all loved it for it was a family refuge and one corner had always been Jo s favorite lounging place Among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one hard round covered with prickly horsehair and furnished with a knobby button at each end This repulsive pillow was her especial property being used as a weapon of defense a barricade or a stern preventive of too much slumber Laurie knew this pillow well and had cause to regard it with deep aversion having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner If the sausage as they called it stood on end it was a sign that he might approach and repose but if it lay flat across the sofa woe to man woman or child who dared disturb it That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner and had not been in her seat five minutes before a massive form appeared beside her and with both arms spread over the sofa back both long legs stretched out before him Laurie exclaimed with a sigh of satisfaction Now this is filling at the price No slang snapped Jo slamming down the pillow But it was too late there was no room for it and coasting onto the floor it disappeared in a most mysterious manner Come Jo don t be thorny After studying himself to a skeleton all the week a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it Beth will pet you I m busy No she s not to be bothered with me but you like that sort of thing unless you ve suddenly lost your taste for it Have you Do you hate your boy and want to fire pillows at him Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard but Jo quenched her boy by turning on him with a stern query How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week Not one upon my word She s engaged Now then I m glad of it that s one of your foolish extravagances sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don t care two pins continued Jo reprovingly Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won t let me send them flowers and things so what can I do My feelings need a vent Mother doesn t approve of flirting even in fun and you do flirt desperately Teddy I d give anything if I could answer So do you As I can t I ll merely say that I don t see any harm in that pleasant little game if all parties understand that it s only play Well it does look pleasant but I can t learn how it s done I ve tried because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else is doing but I don t seem to get on said Jo forgetting to play mentor Take lessons of Amy she has a regular talent for it Yes she does it very prettily and never seems to go too far I suppose it s natural to some people to please without trying and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place I m glad you can t flirt It s really refreshing to see a sensible straightforward girl who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself Between ourselves Jo some of the girls I know really do go on at such a rate I m ashamed of them They don t mean any harm I m sure but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward they d mend their ways I fancy They do the same and as their tongues are the sharpest you fellows get the worst of it for you are as silly as they every bit If you behaved properly they would but knowing you like their nonsense they keep it up and then you blame them Much you know about it ma am said Laurie in a superior tone We don t like romps and flirts though we may act as if we did sometimes The pretty modest girls are never talked about except respectfully among gentleman Bless your innocent soul If you could be in my place for
