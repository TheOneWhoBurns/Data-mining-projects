b as a stone and Amy broke down so Meg and Mother sang alone But in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune As Jo received her good night kiss Mrs March whispered gently My dear don t let the sun go down upon your anger Forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn t quite forgive yet So she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because Amy was listening It was an abominable thing and she doesn t deserve to be forgiven With that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating Jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day It was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter Aunt March had an attack of the fidgets Meg was sensitive Beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldn t even try when other people set them a virtuous example Everybody is so hateful I ll ask Laurie to go skating He is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights I know said Jo to herself and off she went Amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation There She promised I should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have But it s no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me Don t say that You were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but I think she might do it now and I guess she will if you try her at the right minute said Meg Go after them Don t say anything till Jo has got good natured with Laurie than take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and I m sure she ll be friends again with all her heart I ll try said Amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill It was not far to the river but both were ready before Amy reached them Jo saw her coming and turned her back Laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap I ll go on to the first bend and see if it s all right before we begin to race Amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young Russian in his fur trimmed coat and cap Jo heard Amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but Jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister s troubles She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once As Laurie turned the bend he shouted back Keep near the shore It isn t safe in the middle Jo heard but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word Jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear No matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself Laurie had vanished round the bend Jo was just at the turn and Amy far behind striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the river For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down with a sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made Jo s heart stand still with fear She tried to call Laurie but her voice was gone She tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a terror stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water Something rushed swiftly by her and Laurie s voice cried out Bring a rail Quick quick How she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying Laurie who was quite self possessed and lying flat held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt Now then we must walk her home as fast as we can Pile our things on her while I get off these confounded skates cried Laurie wrapping his coat round Amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before Shivering dripping and crying they got Amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles When Amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and Mrs March sitting by the bed she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands Are you sure she is safe whispered Jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice Quite safe dear She is not hurt and won t even take cold I think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully Laurie did it all I only let her go Mother if she should die it would be my fault And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her It s my dreadful temper I try to cure it I think I have and then it breaks out worse than ever Oh Mother what shall I do What shall I do cried poor Jo in despair Watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said Mrs March drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo cried even harder You don t know you can t guess how bad it is It seems as if I could do anything when I m in a passion I get so savage I could hurt anyone and enjoy it I m afraid I shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me Oh Mother help me do help me I will my child I will Don t cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it Jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them You think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it Yours Mother Why you are never angry And for the moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise I ve been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it I am angry nearly every day of my life Jo but I have learned not to show it and I still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her The knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen Mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when Aunt March scolds or people worry you asked Jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before Yes I ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will I just go away for a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered Mrs March with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up Jo s disheveled hair How did you learn to keep still That is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before I know what I m about and the more I say the worse I get till it s a pleasure to hurt people s feelings and say dreadful things Tell me how you do it Marmee dear My good mother used to help me As you do us interrupted Jo with a grateful kiss But I lost her when I was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for I was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else I had a hard time Jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on Then your father came and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good But by and by when I had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for I am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything Poor Mother What helped you then Your father Jo He never loses patience never doubts or complains but always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him He helped and comforted me and showed me that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little girls possess for I was their example It was easier to try for your sakes than for my own A startled or surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them copy Oh Mother if I m ever half as good as you I shall be satisfied cried Jo much touched I hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life You have had a warning Remember it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today I will try Mother I truly will But you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out I used to see Father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away Was he reminding you then asked Jo softly Yes I asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look Jo saw that her mother s eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it I didn t mean to be rude but it s so comfortable to say all I think to you and feel so safe and happy here My Jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much I love them I thought I d grieved you No dear but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him how much I owe him and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him Yet you told him to go Mother and didn t cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said Jo wondering I gave my best to the country I love and kept my tears till he was gone Why should I complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end If I don t seem to need help it is because I have a better friend even than Father to comfort and sustain me My child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one The more you love and trust Him the nearer you will feel to Him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom His love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but may become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength Believe this heartily and go to God with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother Jo s only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words For in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of self denial and self control and led by her mother s hand she had drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before I let the sun go down on my anger I wouldn t forgive her and today if it hadn t been for Laurie it might have been too late How could I be so wicked said Jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow As if she heard Amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to Jo s heart Neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss CHAPTER NINE MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said Meg one April day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise A whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied Jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms And such lovely weather I m so glad of that added Beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said Amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her sister s cushion I wish you were all going but as you can t I shall keep my adventures to tell you when I come back I m sure it s the least I can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said Meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes What did Mother give you out of the treasure box asked Amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs March kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came A pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash I wanted the violet silk but there isn t time to make it over so I must be contented with my old tarlaton It will look nice over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully I wish I hadn t smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said Jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use There is a lovely old fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and Laurie promised to send me all I want replied Meg Now let me see there s my new gray walking suit just curl up the feather in my hat Beth then my poplin for Sunday and the small party it looks heavy for spring doesn t it The violet silk would be so nice Oh dear Never mind you ve got the tarlaton for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said Amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted It isn t low necked and it doesn t sweep enough but it will have to do My blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that I feel as if I d got a new one My silk sacque isn t a bit the fashion and my bonnet doesn t look like Sallie s I didn t like to say anything but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella I told Mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle It s strong and neat so I ought not to complain but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie s silk one with a gold top sighed Meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor Change it advised Jo I won t be so silly or hurt Marmee s feelings when she took so much pains to get my things It s a nonsensical notion of mine and I m not going to give up to it My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort You are a dear to lend me yours Jo I feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps Would you put some on mine she asked as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from Hannah s hands No I wouldn t for the smart caps won t match the plain gowns without any trimming on them Poor folks shouldn t rig said Jo decidedly I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said Meg impatiently You said the other day that you d be perfectly happy if you could only go to Annie Moffat s observed Beth in her quiet way So I did Well I am happy and I won t fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants doesn t it There now the trays are ready and everything in but my ball dress which I shall leave for Mother to pack said Meg cheering up as she glanced from the half filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton which she called her ball dress with an important air The next day was fine and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure Mrs March had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented than she went But she begged so hard and Sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life The Moffats were very fashionable and simple Meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants But they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease Perhaps Meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself It suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use French phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could The more she saw of Annie Moffat s pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich Home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and much injured girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings She had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time They shopped walked rode and called all day went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for Annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them Her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic Meg thought Mr Moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and Mrs Moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done Everyone petted her and Daisey as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned When the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin wouldn t do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed So out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside Sallie s crisp new one Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud No one said a word about it but Sallie offered to dress her hair and Annie to tie her sash and Belle the engaged sister praised her white arms But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies The hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers Before she could speak Annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within It s for Belle of course George always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried Annie with a great sniff They are for Miss March the man said And here s a note put in the maid holding it to Meg What fun Who are they from Didn t know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise The note is from Mother and the flowers from Laurie said Meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her Oh indeed said Annie with a funny look as Meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty Feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that Clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention Somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to Mrs Moffat she saw a happy bright eyed face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didn t strike her as so very shabby now She enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her heart s content Everyone was very kind and she had three compliments Annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice Major Lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and Mr Moffat insisted on dancing with her because she didn t dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it So altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely She was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall How old is he Sixteen or seventeen I should say replied another voice It would be a grand thing for one of those girls wouldn t it Sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them Mrs M has made her plans I dare say and will play her cards well early as it is The girl evidently doesn t think of it yet said Mrs Moffat She told that fib about her momma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily Poor thing She d be so nice if she was only got up in style Do you think she d be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday asked another voice She s proud but I don t believe she d mind for that dowdy tarlaton is all she has got She may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one Here Meg s partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated She was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard For innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends She tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself Mrs M has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlaton till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice As that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears Those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to Meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard Her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs Moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man s daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven Poor Meg had a restless night and got up heavy eyed unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right Everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work Something in the manner of her friends struck Meg at once They treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity All this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air Daisy dear I ve sent an invitation to your friend Mr Laurence for Thursday We should like to know him and it s only a proper compliment to you Meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely You are very kind but I m afraid he won t come Why not Cherie asked Miss Belle He s too old My child what do you mean What is his age I beg to know cried Miss Clara Nearly seventy I believe answered Meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes You sly creature Of course we meant the young man exclaimed Miss Belle laughing There isn t any Laurie is only a little boy And Meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover About your age Nan said Nearer my sister Jo s I am seventeen in August returned Meg tossing her head It s very nice of him to send you flowers isn t it said Annie looking wise about nothing Yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them My mother and old Mr Laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and Meg hoped they would say no more It s evident Daisy isn t out yet said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned Miss Belle with a shrug I m going out to get some little matters for my girls Can I do anything for you young ladies asked Mrs Moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace No thank you ma am replied Sallie I ve got my new pink silk for Thursday and don t want a thing Nor I began Meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them What shall you wear asked Sallie My old white one again if I can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said Meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable Why don t you send home for another said Sallie who was not an observing young lady I haven t got any other It cost Meg an effort to say that but Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise Only that How funny She did not finish her speech for Belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly Not at all Where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn t out yet There s no need of sending home Daisy even if you had a dozen for I ve got a sweet blue silk laid away which I ve outgrown and you shall wear it to please me won t you dear You are very kind but I don t mind my old dress if you don t it does well enough for a little girl like me said Meg Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style I admire to do it and you d be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there I shan t let anyone see you till you are done and then we ll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said Belle in her persuasive tone Meg couldn t refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats On the Thursday evening Belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady They crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and Hortense would have added a soupcon of rouge if Meg had not rebelled They laced her into a sky blue dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror A set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show A cluster of tea rose buds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of high heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart A lace handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll Mademoiselle is charmante tres jolie is she not cried Hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture Come and show yourself said Miss Belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting As Meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like a jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies While I dress do you drill her Nan in the management of her skirt and those French heels or she will trip herself up Take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head Clara and don t any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said Belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success You don t look a bit like yourself but you are very nice I m nowhere beside you for Belle has heaps of taste and you re quite French I assure you Let your flowers hang don t be so careful of them and be sure you don t trip returned Sallie trying not to care that Meg was prettier than herself Keeping that warning carefully in mind Margaret got safely down stairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early guests were assembled She very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect Several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden Several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on the sofas and criticized the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest She heard Mrs Moffat reply to one of them Daisy March father a colonel in the army one of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the Laurences sweet creature I assure you my Ned is quite wild about her Dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of Meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at Mrs Moffat s fibs The queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a side ache the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw Laurie He was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on To complete her confusion she saw Belle nudge Annie and both glance from her to Laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy Silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head I won t care for it or let it change me a bit thought Meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend I m glad you came I was afraid you wouldn t she said with her most grown up air Jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so I did answered Laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone What shall you tell her asked Meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time I shall say I didn t know you for you look so grown up and unlike yourself I m quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glove button How absurd of you The girls dressed me up for fun and I rather like it Wouldn t Jo stare if she saw me said Meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not Yes I think she would returned Laurie gravely Don t you like me so asked Meg No I don t was the blunt reply Why not in an anxious tone He glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it I don t like fuss and feathers That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and Meg walked away saying petulantly You are the rudest boy I ever saw Feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color As she stood there Major Lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother They are making a fool of that little girl I wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely She s nothing but a doll tonight Oh dear sighed Meg I wish I d been sensible and worn my own things then I should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself She leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw Laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out Please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me I m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you said Meg trying to look offended and failing entirely Not a bit of it I m dying to do it Come I ll be good I don t like your gown but I do think you are just splendid And he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration Meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time Take care my skirt doesn t trip you up It s the plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it Pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said Laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of Away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practiced at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff Laurie I want you to do me a favor will you said Meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why Won t I said Laurie with alacrity Please don t tell them at home about my dress tonight They won t understand the joke and it will worry Mother Then why did you do it said Laurie s eyes so plainly that Meg hastily added I shall tell them myself all about it and fess to Mother how silly I ve been But I d rather do it myself So you ll not tell will you I give you my word I won t only what shall I say when they ask me Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time I ll say the first with all my heart but how about the other You don t look as if you were having a good time Are you And Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper No not just now Don t think I m horrid I only wanted a little fun but this sort doesn t pay I find and I m getting tired of it Here comes Ned Moffat What does he want said Laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party He put his name down for three dances and I suppose he s coming for them What a bore said Meg assuming a languid air which amused Laurie immensely He did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as Laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed You ll have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that I wouldn t Meg your mother doesn t like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan I m not Meg tonight I m a doll who does all sorts of crazy things Tomorrow I shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again she answered with an affected little laugh Wish tomorrow was here then muttered Laurie walking off ill pleased at the change he saw in her Meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did After supper she undertook the German and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized Laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture But he got no chance to deliver it for Meg kept away from him till he came to say good night Remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun Silence a la mort replied Laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away This little bit of byplay excited Annie s curiosity but Meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadn t enjoyed herself as much as she expected She was sick all the next day and on Saturday went home quite used up with her fortnight s fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough It does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time Home is a nice place though it isn t splendid said Meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening I m glad to hear you say so dear for I was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day For motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children s faces Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed Meg suddenly left her chair and taking Beth s stool leaned her elbows on her mother s knee saying bravely Marmee I want to fess I thought so What is it dear Shall I go away asked Jo discreetly Of course not Don t I always tell you everything I was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children but I want you to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats We are prepared said Mrs March smiling but looking a little anxious I told you they dressed me up but I didn t tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashion plate Laurie thought I wasn t proper I know he did though he didn t say so and one man called me a doll I knew it was silly but they flattered me and said I was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so I let them make a fool of me Is that all asked Jo as Mrs March looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies No I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said Meg self reproachfully There is something more I think And Mrs March smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly Yes It s very silly but I want to tell it because I hate to have people say and think such things about us and Laurie Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats and as she spoke Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg s innocent mind Well if that isn t the greatest rubbish I ever heard cried Jo indignantly Why didn t you pop out and tell them so on the spot I couldn t it was so embarrassing for me I couldn t help hearing at first and then I was so angry and ashamed I didn t remember that I ought to go away Just wait till I see Annie Moffat and I ll show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff The idea of having plans and being kind to Laurie because he s rich and may marry us by and by Won t he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children And Jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke If you tell Laurie I ll never forgive you She mustn t must she Mother said Meg looking distressed No never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said Mrs March gravely I was very unwise to let you go among people of whom I know so little kind I dare say but worldly ill bred and full of these vulgar ideas about young people I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you Meg Don t be sorry I won t let it hurt me I ll forget all the bad and remember only the good for I did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go I ll not be sentimental or dissatisfied Mother I know I m a silly little girl and I ll stay with you till I m fit to take care of myself But it is nice to be praised and admired and I can t help saying I like it said Meg looking half ashamed of the confession That is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty Meg Margaret sat thinking a moment while Jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort And Jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow Mother do you have plans as Mrs Moffat said asked Meg bashfully Yes my dear I have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from Mrs Moffat s I suspect I will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject You are young Meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you Jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair Holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully Mrs March said in her serious yet cheery way I want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good To be admired loved and respected To have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience It is natural to think of it Meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy My dear girls I am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the world marry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting Money is a needful and precious thing and when well used a noble thing but I never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for I d rather see you poor men s wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without self respect and peace Poor girls don t stand any chance Belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed Meg Then we ll be old maids said Jo stoutly Right Jo Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said Mrs March decidedly Don t be troubled Meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls but so love worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids Leave these things to time Make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not One thing remember my girls Mother is always ready to be your confidant Father to be your friend and both of us hope and trust that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of our lives We will Marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night CHAPTER TEN THE P C AND P O As spring came on a new set of amusements became the fashion and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts The garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with Hannah used to say I d know which each of them gardings belonged to ef I see em in Chiny and so she might for the girls tastes differed as much as their characters Meg s had roses and heliotrope myrtle and a little orange tree in it Jo s bed was never alike two seasons for she was always trying experiments This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers the seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt Cockle top and her family of chicks Beth had old fashioned fragrant flowers in her garden sweet peas and mignonette larkspur pinks pansies and southernwood with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies Amy had a bower in hers rather small and earwiggy but very pretty to look at with honeysuckle and morning glories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it tall white lilies delicate ferns and as many brilliant picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there Gardening walks rows on the river and flower hunts employed the fine days and for rainy ones they had house diversions some old some new all more or less original One of these was the P C for as secret societies were the fashion it was thought proper to have one and as all of the girls admired Dickens they called themselves the Pickwick Club With a few interruptions they had kept this up for a year and met every Saturday evening in the big garret on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp also four white badges with a big P C in different colors on each and the weekly newspaper called The Pickwick Portfolio to which all contributed something while Jo who reveled in pens and ink was the editor At seven o clock the four members ascended to the clubroom tied their badges round their heads and took their seats with great solemnity Meg as the eldest was Samuel Pickwick Jo being of a literary turn Augustus Snodgrass Beth because she was round and rosy Tracy Tupman and Amy who was always trying to do what she couldn t was Nathaniel Winkle Pickwick the president read the paper which was filled with original tales poetry local news funny advertisements and hints in which they good naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short comings On one occasion Mr Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass rapped upon the table hemmed and having stared hard at Mr Snodgrass who was tilting back in his chair till he arranged himself properly began to read THE PICKWICK PORTFOLIO MAY POET S CORNER ANNIVERSARY ODE Again we meet to celebrate With badge and solemn rite Our fifty second anniversary In Pickwick Hall tonight We all are here in perfect health None gone from our small band Again we see each well known face And press each friendly hand Our Pickwick always at his post With reverence we greet As spectacles on nose he reads Our well filled weekly sheet Although he suffers from a cold We joy to hear him speak For words of wisdom from him fall In spite of croak or squeak Old six foot Snodgrass looms on high With elephantine grace And beams upon the company With brown and jovial face Poetic fire lights up his eye He struggles gainst his lot Behold ambition on his brow
