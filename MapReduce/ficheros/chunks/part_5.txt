 And on his nose a blot Next our peaceful Tupman comes So rosy plump and sweet Who chokes with laughter at the puns And tumbles off his seat Prim little Winkle too is here With every hair in place A model of propriety Though he hates to wash his face The year is gone we still unite To joke and laugh and read And tread the path of literature That doth to glory lead Long may our paper prosper well Our club unbroken be And coming years their blessings pour On the useful gay P C A SNODGRASS THE MASKED MARRIAGE A Tale Of Venice Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count Adelon Knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flower girls all mingled gaily in the dance Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm Yes is she not lovely though so sad Her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds Count Antonio whom she passionately hates By my faith I envy him Yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask When that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old Count said the lady as they joined the dance The revel was at its height when a priest appeared and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel Instant silence fell on the gay throng and not a sound but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as Count de Adelon spoke thus My lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter Father we wait your services All eyes turned toward the bridal party and a murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over Then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation Gladly would I give it if I could but I only know that it was the whim of my timid Viola and I yielded to it Now my children let the play end Unmask and receive my blessing But neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand Devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an English earl was the lovely Viola radiant with joy and beauty My lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count Antonio I can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux and De Vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife The count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd Ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph To you my gallant friends I can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have by this masked marriage S PICKWICK Why is the P C like the Tower of Babel It is full of unruly members THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many squashes One day in October when they were ripe he picked one and took it to market A grocerman bought and put it in his shop That same morning a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress with a round face and snub nose went and bought it for her mother She lugged it home cut it up and boiled it in the big pot mashed some of it with salt and butter for dinner And to the rest she added a pint of milk two eggs four spoons of sugar nutmeg and some crackers put it in a deep dish and baked it till it was brown and nice and next day it was eaten by a family named March T TUPMAN Mr Pickwick Sir I address you upon the subject of sin the sinner I mean is a man named Winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and sometimes won t write his piece in this fine paper I hope you will pardon his badness and let him send a French fable because he can t write out of his head as he has so many lessons to do and no brains in future I will try to take time by the fetlock and prepare some work which will be all commy la fo that means all right I am in haste as it is nearly school time Yours respectably N WINKLE The above is a manly and handsome acknowledgment of past misdemeanors If our young friend studied punctuation it would be well A SAD ACCIDENT On Friday last we were startled by a violent shock in our basement followed by cries of distress On rushing in a body to the cellar we discovered our beloved President prostrate upon the floor having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes for in his fall Mr Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form and torn his garments badly On being removed from this perilous situation it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises and we are happy to add is now doing well ED THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT It is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend Mrs Snowball Pat Paw This lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends for her beauty attracted all eyes her graces and virtues endeared her to all hearts and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community When last seen she was sitting at the gate watching the butcher s cart and it is feared that some villain tempted by her charms basely stole her Weeks have passed but no trace of her has been discovered and we relinquish all hope tie a black ribbon to her basket set aside her dish and weep for her as one lost to us forever A sympathizing friend sends the following gem A LAMENT FOR S B PAT PAW We mourn the loss of our little pet And sigh o er her hapless fate For never more by the fire she ll sit Nor play by the old green gate The little grave where her infant sleeps Is neath the chestnut tree But o er her grave we may not weep We know not where it may be Her empty bed her idle ball Will never see her more No gentle tap no loving purr Is heard at the parlor door Another cat comes after her mice A cat with a dirty face But she does not hunt as our darling did Nor play with her airy grace Her stealthy paws tread the very hall Where Snowball used to play But she only spits at the dogs our pet So gallantly drove away She is useful and mild and does her best But she is not fair to see And we cannot give her your place dear Nor worship her as we worship thee A S ADVERTISEMENTS MISS ORANTHY BLUGGAGE the accomplished strong minded lecturer will deliver her famous lecture on WOMAN AND HER

REPORT Meg Good Jo Bad Beth Very Good Amy Middling As the President finished reading the paper which I beg leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls once upon a time a round of applause followed and then Mr Snodgrass rose to make a proposition Mr President and gentlemen he began assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone I wish to propose the admission of a new member one who highly deserves the honor would be deeply grateful for it and would add immensely to the spirit of the club the literary value of the paper and be no end jolly and nice I propose Mr Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P C Come now do have him Jo s sudden change of tone made the girls laugh but all looked rather anxious and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat We ll put it to a vote said the President All in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying Aye A loud response from Snodgrass followed to everybody s surprise by a timid one from Beth Contrary minded say No Meg and Amy were contrary minded and Mr Winkle rose to say with great elegance We don t wish any boys they only joke and bounce about This is a ladies club and we wish to be private and proper I m afraid he ll laugh at our paper and make fun of us afterward observed Pickwick pulling the little curl on her forehead as she always did when doubtful Up rose Snodgrass very much in earnest Sir I give you my word as a gentleman Laurie won t do anything of the sort He likes to write and he ll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental don t you see We can do so little for him and he does so much for us I think the least we can do is to offer him a place here and make him welcome if he comes This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet looking as if he had quite made up his mind Yes we ought to do it even if we are afraid I say he may come and his grandpa too if he likes This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club and Jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly Now then vote again Everybody remember it s our Laurie and say Aye cried Snodgrass excitedly Aye Aye Aye replied three voices at once Good Bless you Now as there s nothing like taking time by the fetlock as Winkle characteristically observes allow me to present the new member And to the dismay of the rest of the club Jo threw open the door of the closet and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter You rogue You traitor Jo how could you cried the three girls as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth and producing both a chair and a badge installed him in a jiffy The coolness of you two rascals is amazing began Mr Pickwick trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile But the new member was equal to the occasion and rising with a grateful salutation to the Chair said in the most engaging manner Mr President and ladies I beg pardon gentlemen allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller the very humble servant of the club Good Good cried Jo pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned My faithful friend and noble patron continued Laurie with a wave of the hand who has so flatteringly presented me is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight I planned it and she only gave in after lots of teasing Come now don t lay it all on yourself You know I proposed the cupboard broke in Snodgrass who was enjoying the joke amazingly Never mind what she says I m the wretch that did it sir said the new member with a Welleresque nod to Mr Pickwick But on my honor I never will do so again and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club Hear Hear cried Jo clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal Go on go on added Winkle and Tupman while the President bowed benignly I merely wish to say that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations I have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden a fine spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails also the females if I may be allowed the expression It s the old martin house but I ve stopped up the door and made the roof open so it will hold all sorts of things and save our valuable time Letters manuscripts books and bundles can be passed in there and as each nation has a key it will be uncommonly nice I fancy Allow me to present the club key and with many thanks for your favor take my seat Great applause as Mr Weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided the warming pan clashed and waved wildly and it was some time before order could be restored A long discussion followed and everyone came out surprising for everyone did her best So it was an unusually lively meeting and did not adjourn till a late hour when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller for a more devoted well behaved and jovial member no club could have He certainly did add spirit to the meetings and a tone to the paper for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent being patriotic classical comical or dramatic but never sentimental Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon Milton or Shakespeare and remodeled her own works with good effect she thought The P O was a capital little institution and flourished wonderfully for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office Tragedies and cravats poetry and pickles garden seeds and long letters music and gingerbread rubbers invitations scoldings and puppies The old gentleman liked the fun and amused himself by sending odd bundles mysterious messages and funny telegrams and his gardener who was smitten with Hannah s charms actually sent a love letter to Jo s care How they laughed when the secret came out never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come CHAPTER ELEVEN EXPERIMENTS The first of June The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow and I m free Three months vacation how I shall enjoy it exclaimed Meg coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion while Beth took off her dusty boots and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party Aunt March went today for which oh be joyful said Jo I was mortally afraid she d ask me to go with her If she had I should have felt as if I ought to do it but Plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard you know and I d rather be excused We had a flurry getting the old lady off and I had a fright every time she spoke to me for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and sweet and feared she d find it impossible to part from me I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage and had a final fright for as it drove of she popped out her head saying Josyphine won t you I didn t hear any more for I basely turned and fled I did actually run and whisked round the corner where I felt safe Poor old Jo She came in looking as if bears were after her said Beth as she cuddled her sister s feet with a motherly air Aunt March is a regular samphire is she not observed Amy tasting her mixture critically She means vampire not seaweed but it doesn t matter It s too warm to be particular about one s parts of speech murmured Jo What shall you do all your vacation asked Amy changing the subject with tact I shall lie abed late and do nothing replied Meg from the depths of the rocking chair I ve been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people so now I m going to rest and revel to my heart s content No said Jo that dozy way wouldn t suit me I ve laid in a heap of books and I m going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree when I m not having l Don t say larks implored Amy as a return snub for the samphire correction I ll say nightingales then with Laurie That s proper and appropriate since he s a warbler Don t let us do any lessons Beth for a while but play all the time and rest as the girls mean to proposed Amy Well I will if Mother doesn t mind I want to learn some new songs and my children need fitting up for the summer They are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes May we Mother asked Meg turning to Mrs March who sat sewing in what they called Marmee s corner You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it I think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play Oh dear no It will be delicious I m sure said Meg complacently I now propose a toast as my friend and pardner Sairy Gamp says Fun forever and no grubbing cried Jo rising glass in hand as the lemonade went round They all drank it merrily and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day Next morning Meg did not appear till ten o clock Her solitary breakfast did not taste good and the room seemed lonely and untidy for Jo had not filled the vases Beth had not dusted and Amy s books lay scattered about Nothing was neat and pleasant but Marmee s corner which looked as usual And there Meg sat to rest and read which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary Jo spent the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide Wide World up in the apple tree Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided but getting tired before half done she left her establishment topsy turvy and went to her music rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash Amy arranged her bower put on her best white frock smoothed her curls and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was As no one appeared but an inquisitive daddy longlegs who examined her work with interest she went to walk got caught in a shower and came home dripping At teatime they compared notes and all agreed that it had been a delightful though unusually long day Meg who went shopping in the afternoon and got a sweet blue muslin had discovered after she had cut the breadths off that it wouldn t wash which mishap made her slightly cross Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating and got a raging headache by reading too long Beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock for Katy Brown s party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey she had nothing to wear But these were mere trifles and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely She smiled said nothing and with Hannah s help did their neglected work keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly It was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the resting and reveling process The days kept getting longer and longer the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers an unsettled feeling possessed everyone and Satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do As the height of luxury Meg put out some of her sewing and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la Moffat Jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books got so fidgety that even good natured Laurie had a quarrel with her and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with Aunt March Beth got on pretty well for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work and fell back into her old ways now and then But something in the air affected her and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she was a fright Amy fared worst of all for her resources were small and when her sisters left her to amuse herself she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden She didn t like dolls fairy tales were childish and one couldn t draw all the time Tea parties didn t amount to much neither did picnics unless very well conducted If one could have a fine house full of nice girls or go traveling the summer would be delightful but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grown up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz complained Miss Malaprop after several days devoted to pleasure fretting and ennui No one would own that they were tired of the experiment but by Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply Mrs March who had a good deal of humor resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system When they got up on Saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the dining room and no mother anywhere to be seen Mercy on us What has happened cried Jo staring about her in dismay Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed Mother isn t sick only very tired and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can It s a very queer thing for her to do she doesn t act a bit like herself But she says it has been a hard week for her so we mustn t grumble but take care of ourselves That s easy enough and I like the idea I m aching for something to do that is some new amusement you know added Jo quickly In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work and they took hold with a will but soon realized the truth of Hannah s saying Housekeeping ain t no joke There was plenty of food in the larder and while Beth and Amy set the table Meg and Jo got breakfast wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work I shall take some up to Mother though she said we were not to think of her for she d take care of herself said Meg who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot So a tray was fitted out before anyone began and taken up with the cook s compliments The boiled tea was very bitter the omelet scorched and the biscuits speckled with saleratus but Mrs March received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo was gone Poor little souls they will have a hard time I m afraid but they won t suffer and it will do them good she said producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself and disposing of the bad breakfast so that their feelings might not be hurt a motherly little deception for which they were grateful Many were the complaints below and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures Never mind I ll get the dinner and be servant you be mistress keep your hands nice see company and give orders said Jo who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs This obliging offer was gladly accepted and Margaret retired to the parlor which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting Jo with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel immediately put a note in the office inviting Laurie to dinner You d better see what you have got before you think of having company said Meg when informed of the hospitable but rash act Oh there s corned beef and plenty of potatoes and I shall get some asparagus and a lobster for a relish as Hannah says We ll have lettuce and make a salad I don t know how but the book tells I ll have blanc mange and strawberries for dessert and coffee too if you want to be elegant Don t try too many messes Jo for you can t make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat I wash my hands of the dinner party and since you have asked Laurie on your own responsibility you may just take care of him I don t want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding You ll give me your advice if I get in a muddle won t you asked Jo rather hurt Yes but I don t know much except about bread and a few trifles You had better ask Mother s leave before you order anything returned Meg prudently Of course I shall I m not a fool And Jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers Get what you like and don t disturb me I m going out to dinner and can t worry about things at home said Mrs March when Jo spoke to her I never enjoyed housekeeping and I m going to take a vacation today and read write go visiting and amuse myself The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred for an eclipse an earthquake or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger Everything is out of sorts somehow she said to herself going downstairs There s Beth crying that s a sure sign that something is wrong in this family If Amy is bothering I ll shake her Feeling very much out of sorts herself Jo hurried into the parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip the canary who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended as if imploring the food for want of which he had died It s all my fault I forgot him there isn t a seed or a drop left Oh Pip Oh Pip How could I be so cruel to you cried Beth taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him Jo peeped into his half open eye felt his little heart and finding him stiff and cold shook her head and offered her domino box for a coffin Put him in the oven and maybe he will get warm and revive said Amy hopefully He s been starved and he shan t be baked now he s dead I ll make him a shroud and he shall be buried in the garden and I ll never have another bird never my Pip for I am too bad to own one murmured Beth sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands The funeral shall be this afternoon and we will all go Now don t cry Bethy It s a pity but nothing goes right this week and Pip has had the worst of the experiment Make the shroud and lay him in my box and after the dinner party we ll have a nice little funeral said Jo beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal Leaving the others to console Beth she departed to the kitchen which was in a most discouraging state of confusion Putting on a big apron she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing when she discovered that the fire was out Here s a sweet prospect muttered Jo slamming the stove door open and poking vigorously among the cinders Having rekindled the fire she thought she would go to market while the water heated The walk revived her spirits and flattering herself that she had made good bargains she trudged home again after buying a very young lobster some very old asparagus and two boxes of acid strawberries By the time she got cleared up the dinner arrived and the stove was red hot Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise Meg had worked it up early set it on the hearth for a second rising and forgotten it Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor when the door flew open and a floury crocky flushed and disheveled figure appeared demanding tartly I say isn t bread riz enough when it runs over the pans Sallie began to laugh but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay Mrs March went out after peeping here and there to see how matters went also saying a word of comfort to Beth who sat making a winding sheet while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box A strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker appeared and said she d come to dinner Now this lady was a thin yellow spinster with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw They disliked her but had been taught to be kind to her simply because she was old and poor and had few friends So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her while she asked questions criticized everything and told stories of the people whom she knew Language cannot describe the anxieties experiences and exertions which Jo underwent that morning and the dinner she served up became a standing joke Fearing to ask any more advice she did her best alone and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever The bread burned black for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves The potatoes had to be hurried not to keep the asparagus waiting and were not done at the last The blanc mange was lumpy and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked having been skilfully deaconed Well they can eat beef and bread and butter if they are hungry only it s mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing thought Jo as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual and stood hot tired and dispirited surveying the feast spread before Laurie accustomed to all sorts of elegance and Miss Crocker whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table as one thing after another was tasted and left while Amy giggled Meg looked distressed Miss Crocker pursed her lips and Laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene Jo s one strong point was the fruit for she had sugared it well and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream Miss Crocker tasted first made a wry face and drank some water hastily Jo who refused thinking there might not be enough for they dwindled sadly after the picking over glanced at Laurie but he was eating away manfully though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate Amy who was fond of delicate fare took a heaping spoonful choked hid her face in her napkin and left the table precipitately Oh what is it exclaimed Jo trembling Salt instead of sugar and the cream is sour replied Meg with a tragic gesture Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying when she met Laurie s eyes which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks So did everyone else even Croaker as the girls called the old lady and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily with bread and butter olives and fun I haven t strength of mind enough to clear up now so we will sober ourselves with a funeral said Jo as they rose and Miss Crocker made ready to go being eager to tell the new story at another friend s dinner table They did sober themselves for Beth s sake Laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove little Pip was laid in with many tears by his tender hearted mistress and covered with moss while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner Here lies Pip March Who died the th of June Loved and lamented sore And not forgotten soon At the conclusion of the ceremonies Beth retired to her room overcome with emotion and lobster but there was no place of repose for the beds were not made and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order Meg helped Jo clear away the remains of the feast which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper Laurie took Amy to drive which was a deed of charity for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper Mrs March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment Before the housewives could rest several people called and there was a scramble to get ready to see them Then tea must be got errands done and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute As twilight fell dewy and still one by one they gathered on the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully and each groaned or sighed as she sat down as if tired or troubled What a dreadful day this has been began Jo usually the first to speak It has seemed shorter than usual but so uncomfortable said Meg Not a bit like home added Amy It can t seem so without Marmee and little Pip sighed Beth glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head Here s Mother dear and you shall have another bird tomorrow if you want it As she spoke Mrs March came and took her place among them looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs Are you satisfied with your experiment girls or do you want another week of it she asked as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces as flowers turn toward the sun I don t cried Jo decidedly Nor I echoed the others You think then that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others do you Lounging and larking doesn t pay observed Jo shaking her head I m tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off Suppose you learn plain cooking That s a useful accomplishment which no woman should be without said Mrs March laughing inaudibly at the recollection of Jo s dinner party for she had met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it Mother did you go away and let everything be just to see how we d get on cried Meg who had had suspicions all day Yes I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully While Hannah and I did your work you got on pretty well though I don t think you were very happy or amiable So I thought as a little lesson I would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself Don t you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes and to bear and forbear that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all We do Mother we do cried the girls Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again for though they seem heavy sometimes they are good for us and lighten as we learn to carry them Work is wholesome and there is plenty for everyone It keeps us from ennui and mischief is good for health and spirits and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion We ll work like bees and love it too see if we don t said Jo I ll learn plain cooking for my holiday task and the next dinner party I have shall be a success I ll make the set of shirts for father instead of letting you do it Marmee I can and I will though I m not fond of sewing That will be better than fussing over my own things which are plenty nice enough as they are said Meg I ll do my lessons every day and not spend so much time with my music and dolls I am a stupid thing and ought to be studying not playing was Beth s resolution while Amy followed their example by heroically declaring I shall learn to make buttonholes and attend to my parts of speech Very good Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it only don t go to the other extreme and delve like slaves Have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well Then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life become a beautiful success in spite of poverty We ll remember Mother and they did CHAPTER TWELVE CAMP LAURENCE Beth was postmistress for being most at home she could attend to it regularly and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail One July day she came in with her hands full and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post Here s your posy Mother Laurie never forgets that she said putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in Marmee s corner and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy Miss Meg March one letter and a glove continued Beth delivering the articles to her sister who sat near her mother stitching wristbands Why I left a pair over there and here is only one said Meg looking at the gray cotton glove Didn t you drop the other in the garden No I m sure I didn t for there was only one in the office I hate to have odd gloves Never mind the other may be found My letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted I think Mr Brooke did it for this isn t Laurie s writing Mrs March glanced at Meg who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown with the little curls blowing about her forehead and very womanly as she sat sewing at her little worktable full of tidy white rolls so unconscious of the thought in her mother s mind as she sewed and sang while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt that Mrs March smiled and was satisfied Two letters for Doctor Jo a book and a funny old hat which covered the whole post office and stuck outside said Beth laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing What a sly fellow Laurie is I said I wished bigger hats were the fashion because I burn my face every hot day He said Why mind the fashion Wear a big hat and be comfortable I said I would if I had one and he has sent me this to try me I ll wear it for fun and show him I don t care for the fashion And hanging the antique broad brim on a bust of Plato Jo read her letters One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill for it said to her My Dear I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch your efforts to control your temper You say nothing about your trials failures or successes and think perhaps that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask if I may trust the well worn cover of your guidebook I too have seen them all and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution since it begins to bear fruit Go on dear patiently and bravely and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving Mother That does me good That s worth millions of money and pecks of praise Oh Marmee I do try I will keep on trying and not get tired since I have you to help me Laying her head on her arms Jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good and this assurance was doubly precious doubly encouraging because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon she pinned the note inside her frock as a shield and a reminder lest she be taken unaware and proceeded to open her other letter quite ready for either good or bad news In a big dashing hand Laurie wrote Dear Jo What ho Some English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to have a jolly time If it s fine I m going to pitch my tent in Longmeadow and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet have a fire make messes gypsy fashion and all sorts of larks They are nice people and like such things Brooke will go to keep us boys steady and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls I want you all to come can t let Beth off at any price and nobody shall worry her Don t bother about rations I ll see to that and everything else only do come there s a good fellow In a tearing hurry Yours ever Laurie Here s richness cried Jo flying in to tell the news to Meg Of course we can go Mother It will be such a help to Laurie for I can row and Meg see to the lunch and the children be useful in some way I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown up people Do you know anything about them Jo asked Meg Only that there are four of them Kate is older than you Fred and Frank twins about my age and a little girl Grace who is nine or ten Laurie knew them abroad and liked the boys I fancied from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her that he didn t admire Kate much I m so glad my French print is clean it s just the thing and so becoming observed Meg complacently Have you anything decent Jo Scarlet and gray boating suit good enough for me I shall row and tramp about so I don t want any starch to think of You ll come Betty If you won t let any boys talk to me Not a boy I like to please Laurie and I m not afraid of Mr Brooke he is so kind But I don t want to play or sing or say anything I ll work hard and not trouble anyone and you ll take care of me Jo so I ll go That s my good girl You do try to fight off your shyness and I love you for it Fighting faults isn t easy as I know and a cheery word kind of gives a lift Thank you Mother And Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss more precious to Mrs March than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth I had a box of chocolate drops and the picture I wanted to copy said Amy showing her mail And I got a note from Mr Laurence asking me to come over and play to him tonight before the lamps are lighted and I shall go added Beth whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely Now let s fly round and do double duty today so that we can play tomorrow with free minds said Jo preparing to replace her pen with a broom When the sun peeped into the girls room early next morning to promise them a fine day he saw a comical sight Each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper Meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead Jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation and Amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature It was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy s ornament Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party and soon a lively bustle began in both houses Beth who was ready first kept reporting what went on next door and enlivened her sisters toilets by frequent telegrams from the window There goes the man with the tent I see Mrs Barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket Now Mr Laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock I wish he would go too There s Laurie looking like a sailor nice boy Oh mercy me Here s a carriage full of people a tall lady a little girl and two dreadful boys One is lame poor thing he s got a crutch Laurie didn t tell us that Be quick girls It s getting late Why there is Ned Moffat I do declare Meg isn t that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping So it is How queer that he should come I thought he was at the mountains There is Sallie I m glad she got back in time Am I all right Jo cried Meg in a flutter A regular daisy Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff Now then come on Oh Jo you are not going to wear that awful hat It s too absurd You shall not make a guy of yourself remonstrated Meg as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad brimmed old fashioned leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke I just will though for it s capital so shady light and big It will make fun and I don t mind being a guy if I m comfortable With that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed a bright little band of sisters all looking their best in summer suits with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner The lawn was the reception room and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate though twenty was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would do well to imitate and who was much flattered by Mr Ned s assurances that he came especially to see her Jo understood why Laurie primmed up his mouth when speaking of Kate for that young lady had a standoff don t touch me air which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls Beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not dreadful but gentle and feeble and she would be kind to him on that account Amy found Grace a well mannered merry little person and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes they suddenly became very good friends Tents lunch and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand the party was soon embarked and the two boats pushed off together leaving Mr Laurence waving his hat on the shore Laurie and Jo rowed one boat Mr Brooke and Ned the other while Fred Vaughn the riotous twin did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug Jo s funny hat deserved a vote of thanks for it was of general utility It broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh it created quite a refreshing breeze flapping to and fro as she rowed and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party if a shower came up she said Miss Kate decided that she was odd but rather clever and smiled upon her from afar Meg in the other boat was delightfully situated face to face with the rowers who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon skill and dexterity Mr Brooke was a grave silent young man with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge He never talked to her much but he looked at her a good deal and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion Ned being in college of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume He was not very wise but very good natured and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous Fred who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks It was not far to Longmeadow but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived A pleasant green field with three wide spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet Welcome to Camp Laurence said the young host as they landed with exclamations of delight Brooke is commander in chief I am commissary general the other fellows are staff officers and you ladies are company The tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen Now let s have a game before it gets hot and then we ll see about dinner Frank Beth Amy and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight Mr Brooke chose Meg Kate and Fred Laurie took Sallie Jo and Ned The English played well but the Americans played better and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of inspired them Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words Jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke which failure ruffled her a good deal Fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers He gave a stroke his ball hit the wicket and stopped an inch on the wrong side No one was very near and running up to examine he gave it a sly nudge with his toe which put it just an inch on the right side I m through Now Miss Jo I ll settle you and get in first cried the young gentleman swinging his mallet for another blow You pushed it I saw you It s my turn now said Jo sharply Upon my word I didn t move it It rolled a bit perhaps but that is allowed So stand off please and let me have a go at the stake We don t cheat in America but you can if you choose said Jo angrily Yankees are a deal the most tricky everybody knows There you go returned Fred croqueting her ball far away Jo opened her lips to say something rude but checked herself in time colored up to her forehead and stood a minute hammering down a wicket with all her might while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation She went off to get her ball and was a long time finding it among the bushes but she came back looking cool and quiet and waited her turn patiently It took several strokes to regain the place she had lost and when she got there the other side had nearly won for Kate s ball was the last but one and l
