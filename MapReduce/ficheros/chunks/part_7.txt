ver lectures all the way home he asked presently Of course not Why Because if you are I ll take a bus If you re not I d like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting I won t preach any more and I d like to hear the news immensely Very well then come on It s a secret and if I tell you you must tell me yours I haven t got any began Jo but stopped suddenly remembering that she had You know you have you can t hide anything so up and fess or I won t tell cried Laurie Is your secret a nice one Oh isn t it All about people you know and such fun You ought to hear it and I ve been aching to tell it this long time Come you begin You ll not say anything about it at home will you Not a word And you won t tease me in private I never tease Yes you do You get everything you want out of people I don t know how you do it but you are a born wheedler Thank you Fire away Well I ve left two stories with a newspaperman and he s to give his answer next week whispered Jo in her confidant s ear Hurrah for Miss March the celebrated American authoress cried Laurie throwing up his hat and catching it again to the great delight of two ducks four cats five hens and half a dozen Irish children for they were out of the city now Hush It won t come to anything I dare say but I couldn t rest till I had tried and I said nothing about it because I didn t want anyone else to be disappointed It won t fail Why Jo your stories are works of Shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day Won t it be fun to see them in print and shan t we feel proud of our authoress Jo s eyes sparkled for it is always pleasant to be believed in and a friend s praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs Where s your secret Play fair Teddy or I ll never believe you again she said trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement I may get into a scrape for telling but I didn t promise not to so I will for I never feel easy in my mind till I ve told you any plummy bit of news I get I know where Meg s glove is Is that all said Jo looking disappointed as Laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence It s quite enough for the present as you ll agree when I tell you where it is Tell then Laurie bent and whispered three words in Jo s ear which produced a comical change She stood and stared at him for a minute looking both surprised and displeased then walked on saying sharply How do you know Saw it Where Pocket All this time Yes isn t that romantic No it s horrid Don t you like it Of course I don t It s ridiculous it won t be allowed My patience What would Meg say You are not to tell anyone Mind that I didn t promise That was understood and I trusted you Well I won t for the present anyway but I m disgusted and wish you hadn t told me I thought you d be pleased At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away No thank you You ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away I d like to see anyone try it cried Jo fiercely So should I and Laurie chuckled at the idea I don t think secrets agree with me I feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that said Jo rather ungratefully Race down this hill with me and you ll be all right suggested Laurie No one was in sight the smooth road sloped invitingly before her and finding the temptation irresistible Jo darted away soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran Laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair bright eyes ruddy cheeks and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face I wish I was a horse then I could run for miles in this splendid air and not lose my breath It was capital but see what a guy it s made me Go pick up my things like a cherub as you are said Jo dropping down under a maple tree which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property and Jo bundled up her braids hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again But someone did pass and who should it be but Meg looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit for she had been making calls What in the world are you doing here she asked regarding her disheveled sister with well bred surprise Getting leaves meekly answered Jo sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up And hairpins added Laurie throwing half a dozen into Jo s lap They grow on this road Meg so do combs and brown straw hats You have been running Jo How could you When will you stop such romping ways said Meg reprovingly as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair with which the wind had taken liberties Never till I m stiff and old and have to use a crutch Don t try to make me grow up before my time Meg It s hard enough to have you change all of a sudden Let me be a little girl as long as I can As she spoke Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman and Laurie s secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near He saw the trouble in her face and drew Meg s attention from it by asking quickly Where have you been calling all so fine At the Gardiners and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle Moffat s wedding It was very splendid and they have gone to spend the winter in Paris Just think how delightful that must be Do you envy her Meg said Laurie I m afraid I do I m glad of it muttered Jo tying on her hat with a jerk Why asked Meg looking surprised Because if you care much about riches you will never go and marry a poor man said Jo frowning at Laurie who was mutely warning her to mind what she said I shall never go and marry anyone observed Meg walking on with great dignity while the others followed laughing whispering skipping stones and behaving like children as Meg said to herself though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on For a week or two Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered She rushed to the door when the postman rang was rude to Mr Brooke whenever they met would sit looking at Meg with a woe begone face occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner Laurie and she were always making signs to one another and talking about Spread Eagles till the girls declared they had both lost their wits On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the window Meg as she sat sewing at her window was scandalized by the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in Amy s bower What went on there Meg could not see but shrieks of laughter were heard followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers What shall we do with that girl She never will behave like a young lady sighed Meg as she watched the race with a disapproving face I hope she won t She is so funny and dear as she is said Beth who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo s having secrets with anyone but her It s very trying but we never can make her commy la fo added Amy who sat making some new frills for herself with her curls tied up in a very becoming way two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike In a few minutes Jo bounced in laid herself on the sofa and affected to read Have you anything interesting there asked Meg with condescension Nothing but a story won t amount to much I guess returned Jo carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight You d better read it aloud That will amuse us and keep you out of mischief said Amy in her most grown up tone What s the name asked Beth wondering why Jo kept her face behind the sheet The Rival Painters That sounds well Read it said Meg With a loud Hem and a long breath Jo began to read very fast The girls listened with interest for the tale was romantic and somewhat pathetic as most of the characters died in the end I like that about the splendid picture was Amy s approving remark as Jo paused I prefer the lovering part Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite names isn t that queer said Meg wiping her eyes for the lovering part was tragical Who wrote it asked Beth who had caught a glimpse of Jo s face The reader suddenly sat up cast away the paper displaying a flushed countenance and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice Your sister You cried Meg dropping her work It s very good said Amy critically I knew it I knew it Oh my Jo I am so proud and Beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success Dear me how delighted they all were to be sure How Meg wouldn t believe it till she saw the words Miss Josephine March actually printed in the paper How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts of the story and offered hints for a sequel which unfortunately couldn t be carried out as the hero and heroine were dead How Beth got excited and skipped and sang with joy How Hannah came in to exclaim Sakes alive well I never in great astonishment at that Jo s doin s How proud Mrs March was when she knew it How Jo laughed with tears in her eyes as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it and how the Spread Eagle might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March as the paper passed from hand to hand Tell us about it When did it come How much did you get for it What will Father say Won t Laurie laugh cried the family all in one breath as they clustered about Jo for these foolish affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy Stop jabbering girls and I ll tell you everything said Jo wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did over her Rival Painters Having told how she disposed of her tales Jo added And when I went to get my answer the man said he liked them both but didn t pay beginners only let them print in his paper and noticed the stories It was good practice he said and when the beginners improved anyone would pay So I let him have the two stories and today this was sent to me and Laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it so I let him And he said it was good and I shall write more and he s going to get the next paid for and I am so happy for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls Jo s breath gave out here and wrapping her head in the paper she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end CHAPTER FIFTEEN A TELEGRAM November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year said Margaret standing at the window one dull afternoon looking out at the frostbitten garden That s the reason I was born in it observed Jo pensively quite unconscious of the blot on her nose If something very pleasant should happen now we should think it a delightful month said Beth who took a hopeful view of everything even November I dare say but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family said Meg who was out of sorts We go grubbing along day after day without a bit of change and very little fun We might as well be in a treadmill My patience how blue we are cried Jo I don t much wonder poor dear for you see other girls having splendid times while you grind grind year in and year out Oh don t I wish I could manage things for you as I do for my heroines You re pretty enough and good enough already so I d have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly Then you d dash out as an heiress scorn everyone who has slighted you go abroad and come home my Lady Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance People don t have fortunes left them in that style nowadays men have to work and women marry for money It s a dreadfully unjust world said Meg bitterly Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all Just wait ten years and see if we don t said Amy who sat in a corner making mud pies as Hannah called her little clay models of birds fruit and faces Can t wait and I m afraid I haven t much faith in ink and dirt though I m grateful for your good intentions Meg sighed and turned to the frostbitten garden again Jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude but Amy spatted away energetically and Beth who sat at the other window said smiling Two pleasant things are going to happen right away Marmee is coming down the street and Laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell In they both came Mrs March with her usual question Any letter from Father girls and Laurie to say in his persuasive way Won t some of you come for a drive I ve been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle and I m going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn It s a dull day but the air isn t bad and I m going to take Brooke home so it will be gay inside if it isn t out Come Jo you and Beth will go won t you Of course we will Much obliged but I m busy And Meg whisked out her workbasket for she had agreed with her mother that it was best for her at least not to drive too often with the young gentleman We three will be ready in a minute cried Amy running away to wash her hands Can I do anything for you Madam Mother asked Laurie leaning over Mrs March s chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her No thank you except call at the office if you ll be so kind dear It s our day for a letter and the postman hasn t been Father is as regular as the sun but there s some delay on the way perhaps A sharp ring interrupted her and a minute after Hannah came in with a letter It s one of them horrid telegraph things mum she said handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage At the word telegraph Mrs March snatched it read the two lines it contained and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart Laurie dashed downstairs for water while Meg and Hannah supported her and Jo read aloud in a frightened voice Mrs March Your husband is very ill Come at once S HALE Blank Hospital Washington How still the room was as they listened breathlessly how strangely the day darkened outside and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change as the girls gathered about their mother feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them Mrs March was herself again directly read the message over and stretched out her arms to her daughters saying in a tone they never forgot I shall go at once but it may be too late Oh children children help me to bear it For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room mingled with broken words of comfort tender assurances of help and hopeful whispers that died away in tears Poor Hannah was the first to recover and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example for with her work was panacea for most afflictions The Lord keep the dear man I won t waste no time a cryin but git your things ready right away mum she said heartily as she wiped her face on her apron gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one and went away to work like three women in one She s right there s no time for tears now Be calm girls and let me think They tried to be calm poor things as their mother sat up looking pale but steady and put away her grief to think and plan for them Where s Laurie she asked presently when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done Here ma am Oh let me do something cried the boy hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see Send a telegram saying I will come at once The next train goes early in the morning I ll take that What else The horses are ready I can go anywhere do anything he said looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth Leave a note at Aunt March s Jo give me that pen and paper Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages Jo drew the table before her mother well knowing that money for the long sad journey must be borrowed and feeling as if she could do anything to add a little to the sum for her father Now go dear but don t kill yourself driving at a desperate pace There is no need of that Mrs March s warning was evidently thrown away for five minutes later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse riding as if for his life Jo run to the rooms and tell Mrs King that I can t come On the way get these things I ll put them down they ll be needed and I must go prepared for nursing Hospital stores are not always good Beth go and ask Mr Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine I m not too proud to beg for Father He shall have the best of everything Amy tell Hannah to get down the black trunk and Meg come and help me find my things for I m half bewildered Writing thinking and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while and let them work Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of wind and the quiet happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell Mr Laurence came hurrying back with Beth bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mother s absence which comforted her very much There was nothing he didn t offer from his own dressing gown to himself as escort But the last was impossible Mrs March would not hear of the old gentleman s undertaking the long journey yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it for anxiety ill fits one for traveling He saw the look knit his heavy eyebrows rubbed his hands and marched abruptly away saying he d be back directly No one had time to think of him again till as Meg ran through the entry with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other she came suddenly upon Mr Brooke I m very sorry to hear of this Miss March he said in the kind quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit I came to offer myself as escort to your mother Mr Laurence has commissions for me in Washington and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there Down dropped the rubbers and the tea was very near following as Meg put out her hand with a face so full of gratitude that Mr Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take How kind you all are Mother will accept I m sure and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her Thank you very very much Meg spoke earnestly and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea and lead the way into the parlor saying she would call her mother Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from Aunt March enclosing the desired sum and a few lines repeating what she had often said before that she had always told them it was absurd for March to go into the army always predicted that no good would come of it and she hoped they would take her advice the next time Mrs March put the note in the fire the money in her purse and went on with her preparations with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she had been there The short afternoon wore away All other errands were done and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework while Beth and Amy got tea and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a slap and a bang but still Jo did not come They began to get anxious and Laurie went off to find her for no one knew what freak Jo might take into her head He missed her however and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance for there was a mixture of fun and fear satisfaction and regret in it which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother saying with a little choke in her voice That s my contribution toward making Father comfortable and bringing him home My dear where did you get it Twenty five dollars Jo I hope you haven t done anything rash No it s mine honestly I didn t beg borrow or steal it I earned it and I don t think you ll blame me for I only sold what was my own As she spoke Jo took off her bonnet and a general outcry arose for all her abundant hair was cut short Your hair Your beautiful hair Oh Jo how could you Your one beauty My dear girl there was no need of this She doesn t look like my Jo any more but I love her dearly for it As everyone exclaimed and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly Jo assumed an indifferent air which did not deceive anyone a particle and said rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it It doesn t affect the fate of the nation so don t wail Beth It will be good for my vanity I was getting too proud of my wig It will do my brains good to have that mop taken off My head feels deliciously light and cool and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop which will be boyish becoming and easy to keep in order I m satisfied so please take the money and let s have supper Tell me all about it Jo I am not quite satisfied but I can t blame you for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity as you call it to your love But my dear it was not necessary and I m afraid you will regret it one of these days said Mrs March No I won t returned Jo stoutly feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned What made you do it asked Amy who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair Well I was wild to do something for Father replied Jo as they gathered about the table for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble I hate to borrow as much as Mother does and I knew Aunt March would croak she always does if you ask for a ninepence Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent and I only got some clothes with mine so I felt wicked and was bound to have some money if I sold the nose off my face to get it You needn t feel wicked my child You had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings said Mrs March with a look that warmed Jo s heart I hadn t the least idea of selling my hair at first but as I went along I kept thinking what I could do and feeling as if I d like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself In a barber s window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked and one black tail not so thick as mine was forty dollars It came to me all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of and without stopping to think I walked in asked if they bought hair and what they would give for mine I don t see how you dared to do it said Beth in a tone of awe Oh he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair He rather stared at first as if he wasn t used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair He said he didn t care about mine it wasn t the fashionable color and he never paid much for it in the first place The work put into it made it dear and so on It was getting late and I was afraid if it wasn t done right away that I shouldn t have it done at all and you know when I start to do a thing I hate to give it up So I begged him to take it and told him why I was in such a hurry It was silly I dare say but it changed his mind for I got rather excited and told the story in my topsy turvy way and his wife heard and said so kindly Take it Thomas and oblige the young lady I d do as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling Who was Jimmy asked Amy who liked to have things explained as they went along Her son she said who was in the army How friendly such things make strangers feel don t they She talked away all the time the man clipped and diverted my mind nicely Didn t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came asked Meg with a shiver I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things and that was the end of it I never snivel over trifles like that I will confess though I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on the table and felt only the short rough ends of my head It almost seemed as if I d an arm or leg off The woman saw me look at it and picked out a long lock for me to keep I ll give it to you Marmee just to remember past glories by for a crop is so comfortable I don t think I shall ever have a mane again Mrs March folded the wavy chestnut lock and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk She only said Thank you deary but something in her face made the girls change the subject and talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr Brooke s kindness the prospect of a fine day tomorrow and the happy times they would have when Father came home to be nursed No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o clock Mrs March put by the last finished job and said Come girls Beth went to the piano and played the father s favorite hymn All began bravely but broke down one by one till Beth was left alone singing with all her heart for to her music was always a sweet consoler Go to bed and don t talk for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get Good night my darlings said Mrs March as the hymn ended for no one cared to try another They kissed her quietly and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble but Meg lay awake thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life Jo lay motionless and her sister fancied that she was asleep till a stifled sob made her exclaim as she touched a wet cheek Jo dear what is it Are you crying about father No not now What then My My hair burst out poor Jo trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow It did not seem at all comical to Meg who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner I m not sorry protested Jo with a choke I d do it again tomorrow if I could It s only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way Don t tell anyone it s all over now I thought you were asleep so I just made a little private moan for my one beauty How came you to be awake I can t sleep I m so anxious said Meg Think about something pleasant and you ll soon drop off I tried it but felt wider awake than ever What did you think of Handsome faces eyes particularly answered Meg smiling to herself in the dark What color do you like best Brown that is sometimes Blue are lovely Jo laughed and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk then amiably promised to make her hair curl and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed smoothing a coverlet here settling a pillow there and pausing to look long and tenderly at each unconscious face to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter As she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright benignant face which seemed to whisper in the silence Be comforted dear soul There is always light behind the clouds CHAPTER SIXTEEN LETTERS In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before For now the shadow of a real trouble had come the little books were full of help and comfort and as they dressed they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them Everything seemed very strange when they went down so dim and still outside so full of light and bustle within Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd and even Hannah s familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on The big trunk stood ready in the hall Mother s cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa and Mother herself sat trying to eat but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution Meg s eyes kept filling in spite of herself Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once and the little girls wore a grave troubled expression as if sorrow was a new experience to them Nobody talked much but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage Mrs March said to the girls who were all busied about her one folding her shawl another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet a third putting on her overshoes and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag Children I leave you to Hannah s care and Mr Laurence s protection Hannah is faithfulness itself and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own I have no fears for you yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly Don t grieve and fret when I am gone or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget Go on with your work as usual for work is a blessed solace Hope and keep busy and whatever happens remember that you never can be fatherless Yes Mother Meg dear be prudent watch over your sisters consult Hannah and in any perplexity go to Mr Laurence Be patient Jo don t get despondent or do rash things write to me often and be my brave girl ready to help and cheer all Beth comfort yourself with your music and be faithful to the little home duties and you Amy help all you can be obedient and keep happy safe at home We will Mother We will The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen That was the hard minute but the girls stood it well No one cried no one ran away or uttered a lamentation though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father remembering as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them They kissed their mother quietly clung about her tenderly and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off and Mr Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him Mr Greatheart on the spot Good by my darlings God bless and keep us all whispered Mrs March as she kissed one dear little face after the other and hurried into the carriage As she rolled away the sun came out and looking back she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen They saw it also and smiled and waved their hands and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces and behind them like a bodyguard old Mr Laurence faithful Hannah and devoted Laurie How kind everyone is to us she said turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man s face I don t see how they can help it returned Mr Brooke laughing so infectiously that Mrs March could not help smiling And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine smiles and cheerful words I feel as if there had been an earthquake said Jo as their neighbors went home to breakfast leaving them to rest and refresh themselves It seems as if half the house was gone added Meg forlornly Beth opened her lips to say something but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother s table showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them It was a little thing but it went straight to their hearts and in spite of their brave resolutions they all broke down and cried bitterly Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings and when the shower showed signs of clearing up she came to the rescue armed with a coffeepot Now my dear young ladies remember what your ma said and don t fret Come and have a cup of coffee all round and then let s fall to work and be a credit to the family Coffee was a treat and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning No one could resist her persuasive nods or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot They drew up to the table exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins and in ten minutes were all right again Hope and keep busy that s the motto for us so let s see who will remember it best I shall go to Aunt March as usual Oh won t she lecture though said Jo as she sipped with returning spirit I shall go to my Kings though I d much rather stay at home and attend to things here said Meg wishing she hadn t made her eyes so red No need of that Beth and I can keep house perfectly well put in Amy with an important air Hannah will tell us what to do and we ll have everything nice when you come home added Beth getting out her mop and dish tub without delay I think anxiety is very interesting observed Amy eating sugar pensively The girls couldn t help laughing and felt better for it though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again and when the two went out to their daily tasks they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother s face It was gone but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony and there she was nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin That s so like my Beth said Jo waving her hat with a grateful face Goodbye Meggy I hope the Kings won t strain today Don t fret about Father dear she added as they parted And I hope Aunt March won t croak Your hair is becoming and it looks very boyish and nice returned Meg trying not to smile at the curly head which looked comically small on her tall sister s shoulders That s my only comfort And touching her hat a la Laurie away went Jo feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day News from their father comforted the girls very much for though dangerously ill the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good Mr Brooke sent a bulletin every day and as the head of the family Meg insisted on reading the dispatches which grew more cheerful as the week passed At first everyone was eager to write and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters who felt rather important with their Washington correspondence As one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party we will rob an imaginary mail and read them My dearest Mother It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us for the news was so good we couldn t help laughing and crying over it How very kind Mr Brooke is and how fortunate that Mr Laurence s business detains him near you so long since he is so useful to you and Father The girls are all as good as gold Jo helps me with the sewing and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs I should be afraid she might overdo if I didn t know her moral fit wouldn t last long Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock and never forgets what you told her She grieves about Father and looks sober except when she is at her little piano Amy minds me nicely and I take great care of her She does her own hair and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings She tries very hard and I know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come Mr Laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen as Jo says and Laurie is very kind and neighborly He and Jo keep us merry for we get pretty blue sometimes and feel like orphans with you so far away Hannah is a perfect saint She does not scold at all and always calls me Miss Margaret which is quite proper you know and treats me with respect We are all well and busy but we long day and night to have you back Give my dearest love to Father and believe me ever your own MEG This note prettily written on scented paper was a great contrast to the next which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly tailed letters My precious Marmee Three cheers for dear Father Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off and let us know the minute he was better I rushed up garret when the letter came and tried to thank God for being so good to us but I could only cry and say I m glad I m glad Didn t that do as well as a regular prayer For I felt a great many in my heart We have such funny times and now I can enjoy them for everyone is so desperately good it s like living in a nest of turtledoves You d laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish She gets prettier every day and I m in love with her sometimes The children are regular archangels and I well I m Jo and never shall be anything else Oh I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie I freed my mind about a silly little thing and he was offended I was right but didn t speak as I ought and he marched home saying he wouldn t come again till I begged pardon I declared I wouldn t and got mad It lasted all day I felt bad and wanted you very much Laurie and I are both so proud it s hard to beg pardon But I thought he d come to it for I was in the right He didn t come and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river I read my little book felt better resolved not to let the sun set on my anger and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry I met him at the gate coming for the same thing We both laughed begged each other s pardon and felt all good and comfortable again I made a pome yesterday when I was helping Hannah wash and as Father likes my silly little things I put it in to amuse him Give him my lovingest hug that ever was and kiss yourself a dozen times for your TOPSY TURVY JO A SONG FROM THE SUDS Queen of my tub I merrily sing While the white foam rises high And sturdily wash and rinse and wring And fasten the clothes to dry Then out in the free fresh air they swing Under the sunny sky I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls The stains of the week away And let water and air by their magic make Ourselves as pure as they Then on the earth there would be indeed A glorious washing day Along the path of a useful life Will heart s ease ever bloom The busy mind has no time to think Of sorrow or care or gloom And anxious thoughts may be swept away As we bravely wield a broom I am glad a task to me is given To labor at day by day For it brings me health and strength and hope And I cheerfully learn to say Head you may think Heart you may feel But Hand you shall work alway Dear Mother There is only room for me to send my love and some pressed pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to see I read every morning try to be good all day and sing myself to sleep with Father s tune I can t sing LAND OF THE LEAL now it makes me cry Everyone is very kind and we are as happy as we can be without you Amy

Thank God he is mending Your sincere friend and servant JAMES LAURENCE CHAPTER SEVENTEEN LITTLE FAITHFUL For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood It was really amazing for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind and self denial was all the fashion Relieved of their first anxiety about their father the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little and began to fall back into old ways They did not forget their motto but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier and after such tremendous exertions they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday and gave it a good many Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough and was ordered to stay at home till she was better for Aunt March didn t like to hear people read with colds in their heads Jo liked this and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books Amy found that housework and art did not go well together and returned to her mud pies Meg went daily to her pupils and sewed or thought she did at home but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother or reading the Washington dispatches over and over Beth kept on with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving All the little duties were faithfully done each day and many of her sisters also for they were forgetful and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a visiting When her heart got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father she went away into a certain closet hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character and when the first excitement was over felt that they had done well and deserved praise So they did but their mistake was in ceasing to do well and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret Meg I wish you d go and see the Hummels You know Mother told us not to forget them said Beth ten days after Mrs March s departure I m too tired to go this afternoon replied Meg rocking comfortably as she sewed Can t you Jo asked Beth Too stormy for me with my cold I thought it was almost well It s well enough for me to go out with Laurie but not well enough to go to the Hummels said Jo laughing but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency Why don t you go yourself asked Meg I have been every day but the baby is sick and I don t know what to do for it Mrs Hummel goes away to work and Lottchen takes care of it But it gets sicker and sicker and I think you or Hannah ought to go Beth spoke earnestly and Meg promised she would go tomorrow Ask Hannah for some nice little mess and take it round Beth the air will do you good said Jo adding apologetically I d go but I want to finish my writing My head aches and I m tired so I thought maybe some of you would go said Beth Amy will be in presently and she will run down for us suggested Meg So Beth lay down on the sofa the others returned to their work and the Hummels were forgotten An hour passed Amy did not come Meg went to her room to try on a new dress Jo was absorbed in her story and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire when Beth quietly put on her hood filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes It was late when she came back and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother s room Half an hour after Jo went to Mother s closet for something and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest looking very grave with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand Christopher Columbus What s the matter cried Jo as Beth put out her hand as if to warn her off and asked quickly You ve had the scarlet fever haven t you Years ago when Meg did Why Then I ll tell you Oh Jo the baby s dead What baby Mrs Hummel s It died in my lap before she got home cried Beth with a sob My poor dear how dreadful for you I ought to have gone said Jo taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother s big chair with a remorseful face It wasn t dreadful Jo only so sad I saw in a minute it was sicker but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor so I took Baby and let Lotty rest It seemed asleep but all of a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled and then lay very still I tried to warm its feet and Lotty gave it some milk but it didn t stir and I knew it was dead Don t cry dear What did you do I just sat and held it softly till Mrs Hummel came with the doctor He said it was dead and looked at Heinrich and Minna who have sore throats Scarlet fever ma am Ought to have called me before he said crossly Mrs Hummel told him she was poor and had tried to cure baby herself but now it was too late and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay He smiled then and was kinder but it was very sad and I cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden and told me to go home and take belladonna right away or I d have the fever No you won t cried Jo hugging her close with a frightened look Oh Beth if you should be sick I never could forgive myself What shall we do Don t be frightened I guess I shan t have it badly I looked in Mother s book and saw that it begins with headache sore throat and queer feelings like mine so I did take some belladonna and I feel better said Beth laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well If Mother was only at home exclaimed Jo seizing the book and feeling that Washington was an immense way off She read a page looked at Beth felt her head peeped into her throat and then said gravely You ve been over the baby every day for more than a week and among the others who are going to have it so I m afraid you are going to have it Beth I ll call Hannah she knows all about sickness Don t let Amy come She never had it and I should hate to give it to her Can t you and Meg have it over again asked Beth anxiously I guess not Don t care if I do Serve me right selfish pig to let you go and stay writing rubbish myself muttered Jo as she went to consult Hannah The good soul was wide awake in a minute and took the lead at once assuring that there was no need to worry every one had scarlet fever and if rightly treated nobody died all of which Jo believed and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg Now I ll tell you what we ll do said Hannah when she had examined and questioned Beth we will have Dr Bangs just to take a look at you dear and see that we start right Then we ll send Amy off to Aunt March s for a spell to keep her out of harm s way and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two I shall stay of course I m oldest began Meg looking anxious and self reproachful I shall because it s my fault she is sick I told Mother I d do the errands and I
