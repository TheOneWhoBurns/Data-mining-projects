shion I ve seen many girls do it so said Amy consolingly Serves me right for trying to be fine I wish I d let my hair alone cried Meg petulantly So do I it was so smooth and pretty But it will soon grow out again said Beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep After various lesser mishaps Meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family Jo s hair was got up and her dress on They looked very well in their simple suits Meg s in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin Jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament Each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine Meg s high heeled slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and Jo s nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die Have a good time dearies said Mrs March as the sisters went daintily down the walk Don t eat much supper and come away at eleven when I send Hannah for you As the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window Girls girls Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs Yes yes spandy nice and Meg has cologne on hers cried Jo adding with a laugh as they went on I do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake It is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied Meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own Now don t forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight Jo Is my sash right And does my hair look very bad said Meg as she turned from the glass in Mrs Gardiner s dressing room after a prolonged prink I know I shall forget If you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned Jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush No winking isn t ladylike I ll lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right Now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and don t shake hands if you are introduced to anyone It isn t the thing How do you learn all the proper ways I never can Isn t that music gay Down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them Mrs Gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon but Jo who didn t care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life She telegraphed her wish to Meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir No one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone She could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began Meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace Unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the Laurence boy Dear me I didn t know anyone was here stammered Jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in But the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled Don t mind me stay if you like Shan t I disturb you Not a bit I only came here because I don t know many people and felt rather strange at first you know So did I Don t go away please unless you d rather The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till Jo said trying to be polite and easy I think I ve had the pleasure of seeing you before You live near us don t you Next door And he looked up and laughed outright for Jo s prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present Grandpa sent it But you put it into his head didn t you now How is your cat Miss March asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun Nicely thank you Mr Laurence But I am not Miss March I m only Jo returned the young lady I m not Mr Laurence I m only Laurie Laurie Laurence what an odd name My first name is Theodore but I don t like it for the fellows called me Dora so I made them say Laurie instead I hate my name too so sentimental I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora I thrashed em I can t thrash Aunt March so I suppose I shall have to bear it And Jo resigned herself with a sigh Don t you like to dance Miss Jo asked Laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her I like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively In a place like this I m sure to upset something tread on people s toes or do something dreadful so I keep out of mischief and let Meg sail about Don t you dance Sometimes You see I ve been abroad a good many years and haven t been into company enough yet to know how you do things here Abroad cried Jo Oh tell me about it I love dearly to hear people describe their travels Laurie didn t seem to know where to begin but Jo s eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers Don t I wish I d been there cried Jo Did you go to Paris We spent last winter there Can you talk French We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay Do say some I can read it but can t pronounce Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis How nicely you do it Let me see you said Who is the young lady in the pretty slippers didn t you Oui mademoiselle It s my sister Margaret and you knew it was Do you think she is pretty Yes she makes me think of the German girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to Meg Both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances Laurie s bashfulness soon wore off for Jo s gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and Jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her She liked the Laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them Curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than I am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly Wonder how old he is It was on the tip of Jo s tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a round about way I suppose you are going to college soon I see you pegging away at your books no I mean studying hard And Jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her Laurie smiled but didn t seem shocked and answered with a shrug Not for a year or two I won t go before seventeen anyway Aren t you but fifteen asked Jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already Sixteen next month How I wish I was going to college You don t look as if you liked it I hate it Nothing but grinding or skylarking And I don t like the way fellows do either in this country What do you like To live in Italy and to enjoy myself in my own way Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time That s a splendid polka Why don t you go and try it If you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow I can t for I told Meg I wouldn t because There Jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh Because what You won t tell Never Well I have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so I burn my frocks and I scorched this one and though it s nicely mended it shows and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it You may laugh if you want to It is funny I know But Laurie didn t laugh He only looked down a minute and the expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently Never mind that I ll tell you how we can manage There s a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us Please come Jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice pearl colored ones her partner wore The hall was empty and they had a grand polka for Laurie danced well and taught her the German step which delighted Jo being full of swing and spring When the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister She beckoned and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale I ve sprained my ankle That stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench It aches so I can hardly stand and I don t know how I m ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain I knew you d hurt your feet with those silly shoes I m sorry But I don t see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered Jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke I can t have a carriage without its costing ever so much I dare say I can t get one at all for most people come in their own and it s a long way to the stable and no one to send I ll go No indeed It s past nine and dark as Egypt I can t stop here for the house is full Sallie has some girls staying with her I ll rest till Hannah comes and then do the best I can I ll ask Laurie He will go said Jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her Mercy no Don t ask or tell anyone Get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things I can t dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes They are going out to supper now I ll stay with you I d rather No dear run along and bring me some coffee I m so tired I can t stir So Meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and Jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old Mr Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment Making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back Oh dear what a blunderbuss I am exclaimed Jo finishing Meg s glove by scrubbing her gown with it Can I help you said a friendly voice And there was Laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other I was trying to get something for Meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here I am in a nice state answered Jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee colored glove Too bad I was looking for someone to give this to May I take it to your sister Oh thank you I ll show you where she is I don t offer to take it myself for I should only get into another scrape if I did Jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies Laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a nice boy They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of Buzz with two or three other young people who had strayed in when Hannah appeared Meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo with an exclamation of pain Hush Don t say anything she whispered adding aloud It s nothing I turned my foot a little that s all and limped upstairs to put her things on Hannah scolded Meg cried and Jo was at her wits end till she decided to take things into her own hands Slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage It happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his grandfather s carriage which had just come for him he said It s so early You can t mean to go yet began Jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer I always go early I do truly Please let me take you home It s all on my way you know and it rains they say That settled it and telling him of Meg s mishap Jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom I had a capital time Did you asked Jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable Yes till I hurt myself Sallie s friend Annie Moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does She is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if Mother only lets me go answered Meg cheering up at the thought I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from Was he nice Oh very His hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and I had a delicious redowa with him He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step Laurie and I couldn t help laughing Did you hear us No but it was very rude What were you about all that time hidden away there Jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home With many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out Tell about the party Tell about the party With what Meg called a great want of manners Jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening I declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me said Meg as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair I don t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them And I think Jo was quite right CHAPTER FOUR BURDENS Oh dear how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on sighed Meg the morning after the party for now the holidays were over the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked I wish it was Christmas or New Year s all the time Wouldn t it be fun answered Jo yawning dismally We shouldn t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now But it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets and go to parties and drive home and read and rest and not work It s like other people you know and I always envy girls who do such things I m so fond of luxury said Meg trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby Well we can t have it so don t let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does I m sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me but I suppose when I ve learned to carry her without complaining she will tumble off or get so light that I shan t mind her This idea tickled Jo s fancy and put her in good spirits but Meg didn t brighten for her burden consisting of four spoiled children seemed heavier than ever She had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way Where s the use of looking nice when no one sees me but those cross midgets and no one cares whether I m pretty or not she muttered shutting her drawer with a jerk I shall have to toil and moil all my days with only little bits of fun now and then and get old and ugly and sour because I m poor and can t enjoy my life as other girls do It s a shame So Meg went down wearing an injured look and wasn t at all agreeable at breakfast time Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned and she couldn t find her rubbers Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready Mrs March was very busy trying to finish a letter which must go at once and Hannah had the grumps for being up late didn t suit her There never was such a cross family cried Jo losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand broken both boot lacings and sat down upon her hat You re the crossest person in it returned Amy washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate Beth if you don t keep these horrid cats down cellar I ll have them drowned exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach Jo laughed Meg scolded Beth implored and Amy wailed because she couldn t remember how much nine times twelve was Girls girls do be quiet one minute I must get this off by the early mail and you drive me distracted with your worry cried Mrs March crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter There was a momentary lull broken by Hannah who stalked in laid two hot turnovers on the table and stalked out again These turnovers were an institution and the girls called them muffs for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings Hannah never forgot to make them no matter how busy or grumpy she might be for the walk was long and bleak The poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two Cuddle your cats and get over your headache Bethy Goodbye Marmee We are a set of rascals this morning but we ll come home regular angels Now then Meg And Jo tramped away feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do They always looked back before turning the corner for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile and wave her hand to them Somehow it seemed as if they couldn t have got through the day without that for whatever their mood might be the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us it would serve us right for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen cried Jo taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind Don t use such dreadful expressions replied Meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world I like good strong words that mean something replied Jo catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether Call yourself any names you like but I am neither a rascal nor a wretch and I don t choose to be called so You re a blighted being and decidedly cross today because you can t sit in the lap of luxury all the time Poor dear just wait till I make my fortune and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and high heeled slippers and posies and red headed boys to dance with How ridiculous you are Jo But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself Lucky for you I am for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal as you do we should be in a nice state Thank goodness I can always find something funny to keep me up Don t croak any more but come home jolly there s a dear Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day each going a different way each hugging her little warm turnover and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather hard work and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure loving youth When Mr March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support at least Believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy industry and independence their parents consented and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary As she said she was fond of luxury and her chief trouble was poverty She found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful life full of ease and pleasure and want of any kind unknown She tried not to be envious or discontented but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things gay friends accomplishments and a happy life At the Kings she daily saw all she wanted for the children s older sisters were just out and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets heard lively gossip about theaters concerts sleighing parties and merrymakings of all kinds and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her Poor Meg seldom complained but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy Jo happened to suit Aunt March who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her The childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came and was much offended because her offer was declined Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady s will but the unworldly Marches only said We can t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes Rich or poor we will keep together and be happy in one another The old lady wouldn t speak to them for a time but happening to meet Jo at a friend s something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady s fancy and she proposed to take her for a companion This did not suit Jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to every one s surprise got on remarkably well with her irascible relative There was an occasional tempest and once Jo marched home declaring she couldn t bear it longer but Aunt March always cleared up quickly and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died Jo remembered the kind old gentleman who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries tell her stories about queer pictures in his Latin books and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street The dim dusty room with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases the cozy chairs the globes and best of all the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked made the library a region of bliss to her The moment Aunt March took her nap or was busy with company Jo hurried to this quiet place and curling herself up in the easy chair devoured poetry romance history travels and pictures like a regular bookworm But like all happiness it did not last long for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story the sweetest verse of a song or the most perilous adventure of her traveler a shrill voice called Josy phine Josy phine and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn wash the poodle or read Belsham s Essays by the hour together Jo s ambition was to do something very splendid What it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn t read run and ride as much as she liked A quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic But the training she received at Aunt March s was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual Josy phine Beth was too bashful to go to school It had been tried but she suffered so much that it was given up and she did her lessons at home with her father Even when he went away and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to Soldiers Aid Societies Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could She was a housewifely little creature and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers never thinking of any reward but to be loved Long quiet days she spent not lonely nor idle for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends and she was by nature a busy bee There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever Not one whole or handsome one among them all were outcasts till Beth took them in for when her sisters outgrew these idols they passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason and set up a hospital for infirm dolls No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals no harsh words or blows were ever given them no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most repulsive but all were fed and clothed nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and having led a tempestuous life was left a wreck in the rag bag from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge Having no top to its head she tied on a neat little cap and as both arms and legs were gone she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly I think it would have touched their hearts even while they laughed She brought it bits of bouquets she read to it took it out to breathe fresh air hidden under her coat she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly I hope you ll have a good night my poor dear Beth had her troubles as well as the others and not being an angel but a very human little girl she often wept a little weep as Jo said because she couldn t take music lessons and have a fine piano She loved music so dearly tried so hard to learn and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument that it did seem as if someone not to hint Aunt March ought to help her Nobody did however and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys that wouldn t keep in tune when she was all alone She sang like a little lark about her work never was too tired for Marmee and the girls and day after day said hopefully to herself I know I ll get my music some time if I m good There are many Beths in the world shy and quiet sitting in corners till needed and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping and the sweet sunshiny presence vanishes leaving silence and shadow behind If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was she would have answered at once My nose When she was a baby Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever It was not big nor red like poor Petrea s it was only rather flat and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point No one minded it but herself and it was doing its best to grow but Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself Little Raphael as her sisters called her had a decided talent for drawing and was never so happy as when copying flowers designing fairies or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments She got through her lessons as well as she could and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment She was a great favorite with her mates being good tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort Her little airs and graces were much admired so were her accomplishments for besides her drawing she could play twelve tunes crochet and read French without mispronouncing more than two thirds of the words She had a plaintive way of saying When Papa was rich we did so and so which was very touching and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled for everyone petted her and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely One thing however rather quenched the vanities She had to wear her cousin s clothes Now Florence s mama hadn t a particle of taste and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet unbecoming gowns and fussy aprons that did not fit Everything was good well made and little worn but Amy s artistic eyes were much afflicted especially this winter when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming My only comfort she said to Meg with tears in her eyes is that Mother doesn t take tucks in my dresses whenever I m naughty as Maria Parks s mother does My dear it s really dreadful for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees and she can t come to school When I think of this deggerredation I feel that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow sky rockets on it Meg was Amy s confidant and monitor and by some strange attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth s To Jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts and over her big harum scarum sister Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family The two older girls were a great deal to one another but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way playing mother they called it and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women Has anybody got anything to tell It s been such a dismal day I m really dying for some amusement said Meg as they sat sewing together that evening I had a queer time with Aunt today and as I got the best of it I ll tell you about it began Jo who dearly loved to tell stories I was reading that everlasting Belsham and droning away as I always do for Aunt soon drops off and then I take out some nice book and read like fury till she wakes up I actually made myself sleepy and before she began to nod I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once I wish I could and be done with it said I trying not to be saucy Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins and told me to sit and think them over while she just lost herself for a moment She never finds herself very soon so the minute her cap began to bob like a top heavy dahlia I whipped the Vicar of Wakefield out of my pocket and read away with one eye on him and one on Aunt I d just got to where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out loud Aunt woke up and being more good natured after her nap told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham I did my very best and she liked it though she only said I don t understand what it s all about Go back and begin it child Back I went and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place and say meekly I m afraid it tires you ma am Shan t I stop now She caught up her knitting which had dropped out of her hands gave me a sharp look through her specs and said in her short way Finish the chapter and don t be impertinent miss Did she own she liked it asked Meg Oh bless you no But she let old Belsham rest and when I ran back after my gloves this afternoon there she was so hard at the Vicar that she didn t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming What a pleasant life she might have if only she chose I don t envy her much in spite of her money for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones I think added Jo That reminds me said Meg that I ve got something to tell It isn t funny like Jo s story but I thought about it a good deal as I came home At the Kings today I found everybody in a flurry and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful and Papa had sent him away I heard Mrs King crying and Mr King talking very loud and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed me so I shouldn t see how red and swollen their eyes were I didn t ask any questions of course but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn t any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family I think being disgraced in school is a great deal try inger than anything bad boys can do said Amy shaking her head as if her experience of life had been a deep one Susie Perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring I wanted it dreadfully and wished I was her with all my might Well she drew a picture of Mr Davis with a monstrous nose and a hump and the words Young ladies my eye is upon you coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing We were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate She was parry lized with fright but she went and oh what do you think he did He took her by the ear the ear Just fancy how horrid and led her to the recitation platform and made her stand there half an hour holding the slate so everyone could see Didn t the girls laugh at the picture asked Jo who relished the scrape Laugh Not one They sat still as mice and Susie cried quarts I know she did I didn t envy her then for I felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldn t have made me happy after that I never never should have got over such a agonizing mortification And Amy went on with her work in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath I saw something I liked this morning and I meant to tell it at dinner but I forgot said Beth putting Jo s topsy turvy basket in order as she talked When I went to get some oysters for Hannah Mr Laurence was in the fish shop but he didn t see me for I kept behind the fish barrel and he was busy with Mr Cutter the fish man A poor woman came in with a pail and a mop and asked Mr Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish because she hadn t any dinner for her children and had been disappointed of a day s work Mr Cutter was in a hurry and said No rather crossly so she was going away looking hungry and sorry when Mr Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her She was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms and thanked him over and over He told her to go along and cook it and she hurried off so happy Wasn t it good of him Oh she did look so funny hugging the big slippery fish and hoping Mr Laurence s bed in heaven would be aisy When they had laughed at Beth s story they asked their mother for one and after a moments thought she said soberly As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms I felt very anxious about Father and thought how lonely and helpless we should be if anything happened to him It was not a wise thing to do but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes He sat down near me and I began to talk to him for he looked poor and tired and anxious Have you sons in the army I asked for the note he brought was not to me Yes ma am I had four but two were killed one is a prisoner and I m going to the other who is very sick in a Washington hospital he answered quietly You have done a great deal for your country sir I said feeling respect now instead of pity Not a mite more than I ought ma am I d go myself if I was any use As I ain t I give my boys and give em free He spoke so cheerfully looked so sincere and seemed so glad to give his all that I was ashamed of myself I d given one man and thought it too much while he gave four without grudging them I had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say good by to him perhaps I felt so rich so happy thinking of my blessings that I made him a nice bundle gave him some money and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me Tell another story Mother one with a moral to it like this I like to think about them afterward if they are real and not too preachy said Jo after a minute s silence Mrs March smiled and began at once for she had told stories to this little audience for many years and knew how to please them Once upon a time there were four girls who had enough to eat and drink and wear a good many comforts and pleasures kind friends and parents who loved them dearly and yet they were not contented Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another and began to sew diligently These girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions but they did not keep them very well and were constantly saying If only we had this or If we could only do that quite forgetting how much they already had and how many things they actually could do So they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy and she said When you feel discontented think over your blessings and be grateful Here Jo looked up quickly as if about to speak but changed her mind seeing that the story was not done yet Being sensible girls they decided to try her advice and soon were surprised to see how well off they were One discovered that money couldn t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people s houses another that though she was poor she was a great deal happier with her youth health and good spirits than a certain fretful feeble old lady who couldn t enjoy her comforts a third that disagreeable as it was to help get dinner it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior So they agreed to stop complaining to enjoy the blessings already possessed and try to deserve them lest they should be taken away entirely instead of increased and I believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman s advice Now Marmee that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us and give us a sermon instead of a romance cried Meg I like that kind of sermon It s the sort Father used to tell us said Beth thoughtfully putting the needles straight on Jo s cushion I don t complain near as much as the others do and I shall be more careful than ever now for I ve had warning from Susie s downfall said Amy morally We needed that lesson and we won t forget it If we do so you just say to us as old Chloe did in Uncle Tom Tink ob yer marcies chillen Tink ob yer marcies added Jo who could not for the life of her help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon though she took it to heart as much as any of them CHAPTER FIVE BEING NEIGHBORLY What in the world are you going to do now Jo asked Meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other Going out for exercise answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough It s cold and dull out and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as I do said Meg with a shiver Never take advice Can t keep still all day and not being a pussycat I don t like to doze by the fire I like adventures and I m going to find some Meg went back to toast her feet and read Ivanhoe and Jo began to dig paths with great energy The snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air Now the garden separated the Marches house from that of Mr Laurence Both stood in a suburb of the city which was still country like with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets A low hedge parted the two estates On one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it On the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coach house and well kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains Yet it seemed a lonely lifeless sort of house for no children frolicked on the lawn no motherly face ever smiled at the windows and few people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson To Jo s lively fancy this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed She had long wanted to behold these hidden glories and to know the Laurence boy who looked as if he would like to be known if he only knew how to begin Since the party she had been more eager than ever and had planned many ways of making friends with him but he had not been seen lately and Jo began to think he had gone away when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window looking wistfully down into their garden where Beth and Amy were snow balling one another That boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself His grandpa does not know what s good for him and keeps him shut up all alone He needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively I ve a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so The idea amused Jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances The plan of going over was not forgotten And when the snowy afternoon came Jo resolved to try what could be done She saw Mr Lawrence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey All quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window There he is thought Jo Poor boy All alone and sick this dismal day It s a shame I ll toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him Up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile Jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out How do you do Are you sick Laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven Better thank you I ve had a bad cold and been shut up a week I m sorry What do you amuse yourself with Nothing It s dull as tombs up here Don t you read Not much They won t let me Can t somebody read to you Grandpa does sometimes but my books don t interest him and I hate to ask Brooke all the time Have someone come and see you then There isn t anyone I d like to see Boys make such a row and my head is weak Isn t there some nice girl who d read and amuse you Girls are quiet and like to play nurse Don t know any You know us began Jo then laughed and stopped So I do Will you come please cried Laurie I m not quiet and nice but I ll come if Mother will let me I ll go ask her Shut the window like a good boy and wait till I come With that Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as Mrs March said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh color and trying to tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat Presently there came a loud ring then a decided voice asking for Mr Laurie and a surprised looking servant came running up to announce a young lady All right show her up it s Miss Jo said Laurie going to the door of his little parlor to meet Jo who appeared looking rosy and quite at her ease with a covered dish in one hand and Beth s three kittens in the other Here I am bag and baggage she said briskly Mother sent her love and was glad if I could do anything for you Meg wanted me to bring some of her blanc mange she makes it very nicely and Beth thought her cats would be comforting I knew you d laugh at them but I couldn t refuse she was so anxious to do something It so happened that Beth s funny loan was just the thing for in laughing over the kits Laurie forgot his bashfulness and grew sociable at once That looks too pretty to eat he said smiling with pleasure as Jo uncovered the dish and showed the blanc mange surrounded by a garland of green leaves and the scarlet flowers of Amy s pet geranium It isn t anything only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it Tell the girl to put it away for your tea It s so simple you can eat it and being soft it will slip down without hurting your sore throat What a cozy room this is It might be if it was kept nice but the maids are lazy and I don t know how to make them mind It worries me though I ll right it up in two minutes for it only needs to have the hearth brushed so and the things made straight on the mantelpiece so and the books put here and the bottles there and your sofa turned from the light and the pillows plumped up a bit Now then you re fixed And so he was for as she laughed and talked Jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room Laurie watched her in respectful silence and when she beckoned him to his sofa he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction saying gratefully How kind you are Yes that s what it wanted Now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company No I came to amuse you Shall I read aloud and Jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by Thank you I ve read all those and if you don t mind I d rather talk answered Laurie Not a bit I ll talk all day if you ll only set me going Beth says I never know when to stop Is Beth the rosy one who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked Laurie with interest Yes that s Beth She s my girl and a regular good one she is too The pretty one is Meg and the curly haired one is Amy I believe How did you find that out Laurie colored up but answered frankly Why you see I often hear you calling to one another and when I m alone up here I can t help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times I beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are And when the lamps are lighted it s like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother Her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers I can t help watching it I haven t got any mother you know And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control The solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo s warm heart She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child Laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said We ll never draw that curtain any more and I give you leave to look as much as you like I just wish though instead of peeping you d come over and see us Mother is so splendid she d do you heaps of good and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to and Amy would dance Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and we d have jolly times Wouldn t your grandpa let you I think he would if your mother asked him He s very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what I like pretty much only he s afraid I might be a bother to strangers began Laurie brightening more and more We are not strangers we are neighbors and you needn t think you d be a bother We want to know you and I ve been trying to do it this ever so long We haven t been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you You see Grandpa lives among his books and doesn t mind much what happens outside Mr Brooke my tutor doesn t stay here you know and I have no one to go about with me so I just stop at home and get on as I can That s bad You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then you ll have plenty of friends and pleasant places to go to Never mind being
