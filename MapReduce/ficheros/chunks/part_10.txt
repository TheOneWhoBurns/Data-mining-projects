nd I m so surprised to see you stammered Meg feeling that she was in for a lecture now That s evident returned Aunt March sitting down But what is Father s friend saying to make you look like a peony There s mischief going on and I insist upon knowing what it is with another rap We were only talking Mr Brooke came for his umbrella began Meg wishing that Mr Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house Brooke That boy s tutor Ah I understand now I know all about it Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father s letters and I made her tell me You haven t gone and accepted him child cried Aunt March looking scandalized Hush He ll hear Shan t I call Mother said Meg much troubled Not yet I ve something to say to you and I must free my mind at once Tell me do you mean to marry this Cook If you do not one penny of my money ever goes to you Remember that and be a sensible girl said the old lady impressively Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people and enjoyed doing it The best of us have a spice of perversity in us especially when we are young and in love If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke she would probably have declared she couldn t think of it but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him she immediately made up her mind that she would Inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy and being already much excited Meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit I shall marry whom I please Aunt March and you can leave your money to anyone you like she said nodding her head with a resolute air Highty tighty Is that the way you take my advice Miss You ll be sorry for it by and by when you ve tried love in a cottage and found it a failure It can t be a worse one than some people find in big houses retorted Meg Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl for she did not know her in this new mood Meg hardly knew herself she felt so brave and independent so glad to defend John and assert her right to love him if she liked Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong and after a little pause made a fresh start saying as mildly as she could Now Meg my dear be reasonable and take my advice I mean it kindly and don t want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning You ought to marry well and help your family It s your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you Father and Mother don t think so They like John though he is poor Your parents my dear have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of babies I m glad of it cried Meg stoutly Aunt March took no notice but went on with her lecture This Rook is poor and hasn t got any rich relations has he No but he has many warm friends You can t live on friends try it and see how cool they ll grow He hasn t any business has he Not yet Mr Laurence is going to help him That won t last long James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on So you intend to marry a man without money position or business and go on working harder than you do now when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better I thought you had more sense Meg I couldn t do better if I waited half my life John is good and wise he s got heaps of talent he s willing to work and sure to get on he s so energetic and brave Everyone likes and respects him and I m proud to think he cares for me though I m so poor and young and silly said Meg looking prettier than ever in her earnestness He knows you have got rich relations child That s the secret of his liking I suspect Aunt March how dare you say such a thing John is above such meanness and I won t listen to you a minute if you talk so cried Meg indignantly forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady s suspicions My John wouldn t marry for money any more than I would We are willing to work and we mean to wait I m not afraid of being poor for I ve been happy so far and I know I shall be with him because he loves me and I Meg stopped there remembering all of a sudden that she hadn t made up her mind that she had told her John to go away and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks Aunt March was very angry for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match and something in the girl s happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour Well I wash my hands of the whole affair You are a willful child and you ve lost more than you know by this piece of folly No I won t stop I m disappointed in you and haven t spirits to see your father now Don t expect anything from me when you are married Your Mr Brooke s friends must take care of you I m done with you forever And slamming the door in Meg s face Aunt March drove off in high dudgeon She seemed to take all the girl s courage with her for when left alone Meg stood for a moment undecided whether to laugh or cry Before she could make up her mind she was taken possession of by Mr Brooke who said all in one breath I couldn t help hearing Meg Thank you for defending me and Aunt March for proving that you do care for me a little bit I didn t know how much till she abused you began Meg And I needn t go away but may stay and be happy may I dear Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit but Meg never thought of doing either and disgraced herself forever in Jo s eyes by meekly whispering Yes John and hiding her face on Mr Brooke s waistcoat Fifteen minutes after Aunt March s departure Jo came softly downstairs paused an instant at the parlor door and hearing no sound within nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression saying to herself She has seen him away as we planned and that affair is settled I ll go and hear the fun and have a good laugh over it But poor Jo never got her laugh for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes Going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strong minded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission Jo gave a sort of gasp as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away At the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her Meg jumped up looking both proud and shy but that man as Jo called him actually laughed and said coolly as he kissed the astonished newcomer Sister Jo congratulate us That was adding insult to injury it was altogether too much and making some wild demonstration with her hands Jo vanished without a word Rushing upstairs she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room Oh do somebody go down quick John Brooke is acting dreadfully and Meg likes it Mr and Mrs March left the room with speed and casting herself upon the bed Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to Beth and Amy The little girls however considered it a most agreeable and interesting event and Jo got little comfort from them so she went up to her refuge in the garret and confided her troubles to the rats Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon but a great deal of talking was done and quiet Mr Brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit told his plans and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for Meg and he proudly took her in to supper both looking so happy that Jo hadn t the heart to be jealous or dismal Amy was very much impressed by John s devotion and Meg s dignity Beth beamed at them from a distance while Mr and Mrs March surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident Aunt March was right in calling them as unworldly as a pair of babies No one ate much but everyone looked very happy and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there You can t say nothing pleasant ever happens now can you Meg said Amy trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she was planning to make No I m sure I can t How much has happened since I said that It seems a year ago answered Meg who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter The joys come close upon the sorrows this time and I rather think the changes have begun said Mrs March In most families there comes now and then a year full of events This has been such a one but it ends well after all Hope the next will end better muttered Jo who found it very hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face for Jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way I hope the third year from this will end better I mean it shall if I live to work out my plans said Mr Brooke smiling at Meg as if everything had become possible to him now Doesn t it seem very long to wait asked Amy who was in a hurry for the wedding I ve got so much to learn before I shall be ready it seems a short time to me answered Meg with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before You have only to wait I am to do the work said John beginning his labors by picking up Meg s napkin with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged Here comes Laurie Now we shall have some sensible conversation But Jo was mistaken for Laurie came prancing in overflowing with good spirits bearing a great bridal looking bouquet for Mrs John Brooke and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management I knew Brooke would have it all his own way he always does for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything it s done though the sky falls said Laurie when he had presented his offering and his congratulations Much obliged for that recommendation I take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot answered Mr Brooke who felt at peace with all mankind even his mischievous pupil I ll come if I m at the ends of the earth for the sight of Jo s face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey You don t look festive ma am what s the matter asked Laurie following her into a corner of the parlor whither all had adjourned to greet Mr Laurence I don t approve of the match but I ve made up my mind to bear it and shall not say a word against it said Jo solemnly You can t know how hard it is for me to give up Meg she continued with a little quiver in her voice You don t give her up You only go halves said Laurie consolingly It can never be the same again I ve lost my dearest friend sighed Jo You ve got me anyhow I m not good for much I know but I ll stand by you Jo all the days of my life Upon my word I will and Laurie meant what he said I know you will and I m ever so much obliged You are always a great comfort to me Teddy returned Jo gratefully shaking hands Well now don t be dismal there s a good fellow It s all right you see Meg is happy Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately Grandpa will attend to him and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her own little house We ll have capital times after she is gone for I shall be through college before long and then we ll go abroad on some nice trip or other Wouldn t that console you I rather think it would but there s no knowing what may happen in three years said Jo thoughtfully That s true Don t you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then I do returned Laurie I think not for I might see something sad and everyone looks so happy now I don t believe they could be much improved And Jo s eyes went slowly round the room brightening as they looked for the prospect was a pleasant one Father and Mother sat together quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago Amy was drawing the lovers who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy Beth lay on her sofa talking cheerily with her old friend who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked Jo lounged in her favorite low seat with the grave quiet look which best became her and Laurie leaning on the back of her chair his chin on a level with her curly head smiled with his friendliest aspect and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both So the curtain falls upon Meg Jo Beth and Amy Whether it ever rises again depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women PART In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg s wedding CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR GOSSIP In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg s wedding with free minds it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much lovering in the story as I fear they may I m not afraid the young folks will make that objection I can only say with Mrs March What can you expect when I have four gay girls in the house and a dashing young neighbor over the way The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family The war is over and Mr March safely at home busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace a quiet studious man rich in the wisdom that is better than learning the charity which calls all mankind brother the piety that blossoms into character making it august and lovely These attributes in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes attracted to him many admirable persons as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop Earnest young men found the gray headed scholar as young at heart as they thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him sure of finding the gentlest sympathy the wisest counsel Sinners told their sins to the pure hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved Gifted men found a companion in him Ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true although they wouldn t pay To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house and so they did in many things but the quiet scholar sitting among his books was still the head of the family the household conscience anchor and comforter for to him the busy anxious women always turned in troublous times finding him in the truest sense of those sacred words husband and father The girls gave their hearts into their mother s keeping their souls into their father s and to both parents who lived and labored so faithfully for them they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death Mrs March is as brisk and cheery though rather grayer than when we saw her last and just now so absorbed in Meg s affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded boys and soldiers widows decidedly miss the motherly missionary s visits John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year got wounded was sent home and not allowed to return He received no stars or bars but he deserved them for he cheerfully risked all he had and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom Perfectly resigned to his discharge he devoted himself to getting well preparing for business and earning a home for Meg With the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him he refused Mr Laurence s more generous offers and accepted the place of bookkeeper feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting growing womanly in character wise in housewifely arts and prettier than ever for love is a great beautifier She had her girlish ambitions and hopes and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner and Meg couldn t help contrasting their fine house and carriage many gifts and splendid outfit with her own and secretly wishing she could have the same But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her and when they sat together in the twilight talking over their small plans the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie s splendor and felt herself the richest happiest girl in Christendom Jo never went back to Aunt March for the old lady took such a fancy to Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going and for the sake of this advantage Amy would have served a far harder mistress So she gave her mornings to duty her afternoons to pleasure and prospered finely Jo meantime devoted herself to literature and Beth who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past Not an invalid exactly but never again the rosy healthy creature she had been yet always hopeful happy and serene and busy with the quiet duties she loved everyone s friend and an angel in the house long before those who loved her most had learned to know it As long as The Spread Eagle paid her a dollar a column for her rubbish as she called it Jo felt herself a woman of means and spun her little romances diligently But great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript which was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame Laurie having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself A universal favorite thanks to money manners much talent and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them he stood in great danger of being spoiled and probably would have been like many another promising boy if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son and last but not least by any means the knowledge that four innocent girls loved admired and believed in him with all their hearts Being only a glorious human boy of course he frolicked and flirted grew dandified aquatic sentimental or gymnastic as college fashions ordained hazed and was hazed talked slang and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion But as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks he always managed to save himself by frank confession honorable atonement or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection In fact he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors dignified professors and vanquished enemies The men of my class were heroes in the eyes of the girls who never wearied of the exploits of our fellows and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures when Laurie brought them home with him Amy especially enjoyed this high honor and became quite a belle among them for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed Meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular John to care for any other lords of creation and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how Amy dared to order them about so but Jo felt quite in her own element and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes phrases and feats which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies They all liked Jo immensely but never fell in love with her though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy s shrine And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the Dovecote That was the name of the little brown house Mr Brooke had prepared for Meg s first home Laurie had christened it saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who went on together like a pair of turtledoves with first a bill and then a coo It was a tiny house with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front Here Meg meant to have a fountain shrubbery and a profusion of lovely flowers though just at present the fountain was represented by a weather beaten urn very like a dilapidated slopbowl the shrubbery consisted of several young larches undecided whether to live or die and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted But inside it was altogether charming and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar To be sure the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano for one never could have been got in whole the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pell mell into the coalbin But once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing and the result was highly satisfactory There were no marble topped tables long mirrors or lace curtains in the little parlor but simple furniture plenty of books a fine picture or two a stand of flowers in the bay window and scattered all about the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought I don t think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty because John put up the bracket it stood upon that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy s artistic hand or that any store room was ever better provided with good wishes merry words and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg s few boxes barrels and bundles and I am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute Mis Brooke came home I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters holders and piece bags for Beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china People who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table was eloquent of home love and tender forethought What happy times they had planning together what solemn shopping excursions what funny mistakes they made and what shouts of laughter arose over Laurie s ridiculous bargains In his love of jokes this young gentleman though nearly through college was a much of a boy as ever His last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new useful and ingenious article for the young housekeeper Now a bag of remarkable clothespins next a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt labor saving soap that took the skin off one s hands infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer and every kind of tinware from a toy savings bank for odd pennies to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process In vain Meg begged him to stop John laughed at him and Jo called him Mr Toodles He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee ingenuity and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth So each week beheld some fresh absurdity Everything was done at last even to Amy s arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms and Beth s setting the table for the first meal Are you satisfied Does it seem like home and do you feel as if you should be happy here asked Mrs March as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever Yes Mother perfectly satisfied thanks to you all and so happy that I can t talk about it with a look that was far better than words If she only had a servant or two it would be all right said Amy coming out of the parlor where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece Mother and I have talked that over and I have made up my mind to try her way first There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there I shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick answered Meg tranquilly Sallie Moffat has four began Amy If Meg had four the house wouldn t hold them and master and missis would have to camp in the garden broke in Jo who enveloped in a big blue pinafore was giving the last polish to the door handles Sallie isn t a poor man s wife and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment Meg and John begin humbly but I have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one It s a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress give orders and gossip When I was first married I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn so that I might have the pleasure of mending them for I got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief Why didn t you go into the kitchen and make messes as Sallie says she does to amuse herself though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her said Meg I did after a while not to mess but to learn of Hannah how things should be done that my servants need not laugh at me It was play then but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help You begin at the other end Meg dear but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you by and by when John is a richer man for the mistress of a house however splendid should know how work ought to be done if she wishes to be well and honestly served Yes Mother I m sure of that said Meg listening respectfully to the little lecture for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping Do you know I like this room most of all in my baby house added Meg a minute after as they went upstairs and she looked into her well stored linen closet Beth was there laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array All three laughed as Meg spoke for that linen closet was a joke You see having said that if Meg married that Brooke she shouldn t have a cent of her money Aunt March was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow She never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself Mrs Carrol Florence s mamma was ordered to buy have made and marked a generous supply of house and table linen and send it as her present all of which was faithfully done but the secret leaked out and was greatly enjoyed by the family for Aunt March tried to look utterly unconscious and insisted that she could give nothing but the old fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride That s a housewifely taste which I am glad to see I had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her said Mrs March patting the damask tablecloths with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness I haven t a single finger bowl but this is a setout that will last me all my days Hannah says And Meg looked quite contented as well she might A tall broad shouldered young fellow with a cropped head a felt basin of a hat and a flyaway coat came tramping down the road at a great pace walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate straight up to Mrs March with both hands out and a hearty Here I am Mother Yes it s all right The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed as usual with a motherly kiss For Mrs John Brooke with the maker s congratulations and compliments Bless you Beth What a refreshing spectacle you are Jo Amy you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady As Laurie spoke he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg pulled Beth s hair ribbon stared at Jo s big pinafore and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy then shook hands all round and everyone began to talk Where is John asked Meg anxiously Stopped to get the license for tomorrow ma am Which side won the last match Teddy inquired Jo who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years Ours of course Wish you d been there to see How is the lovely Miss Randal asked Amy with a significant smile More cruel than ever Don t you see how I m pining away and Laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh What s the last joke Undo the bundle and see Meg said Beth eying the knobby parcel with curiosity It s a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves observed Laurie as a watchman s rattle appeared amid the laughter of the girls Any time when John is away and you get frightened Mrs Meg just swing that out of the front window and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy Nice thing isn t it and Laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears There s gratitude for you And speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction I saw it going into your house as I came by and if she hadn t defended it manfully I d have had a pick at it for it looked like a remarkably plummy one I wonder if you will ever grow up Laurie said Meg in a matronly tone I m doing my best ma am but can t get much higher I m afraid as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days responded the young gentleman whose head was about level with the little chandelier I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick and span bower so as I m tremendously hungry I propose an adjournment he added presently Mother and I are going to wait for John There are some last things to settle said Meg bustling away Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant s to get more flowers for tomorrow added Amy tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls and enjoying the effect as much as anybody Come Jo don t desert a fellow I m in such a state of exhaustion I can t get home without help Don t take off your apron whatever you do it s peculiarly becoming said Laurie as Jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps Now Teddy I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow began Jo as they strolled away together You must promise to behave well and not cut up any pranks and spoil our plans Not a prank And don t say funny things when we ought to be sober I never do You are the one for that And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony I shall certainly laugh if you do You won t see me you ll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect I never cry unless for some great affliction Such as fellows going to college hey cut in Laurie with suggestive laugh Don t be a peacock I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company Exactly I say Jo how is Grandpa this week Pretty amiable Very Why have you got into a scrape and want to know how he ll take it asked Jo rather sharply Now Jo do you think I d look your mother in the face and say All right if it wasn t and Laurie stopped short with an injured air No I don t Then don t go and be suspicious I only want some money said Laurie walking on again appeased by her hearty tone You spend a great deal Teddy Bless you I don t spend it it spends itself somehow and is gone before I know it You are so generous and kind hearted that you let people borrow and can t say No to anyone We heard about Henshaw and all you did for him If you always spent money in that way no one would blame you said Jo warmly Oh he made a mountain out of a molehill You wouldn t have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps would you Of course not but I don t see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats endless neckties and a new hat every time you come home I thought you d got over the dandy period but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot Just now it s the fashion to be hideous to make your head look like a scrubbing brush wear a strait jacket orange gloves and clumping square toed boots If it was cheap ugliness I d say nothing but it costs as much as the other and I don t get any satisfaction out of it Laurie threw back his head and laughed so heartily at this attack that the felt hat fell off and Jo walked on it which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a rough and ready costume as he folded up the maltreated hat and stuffed it into his pocket Don t lecture any more there s a good soul I have enough all through the week and like to enjoy myself when I come home I ll get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends I ll leave you in peace if you ll only let your hair grow I m not aristocratic but I do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter observed Jo severely This unassuming style promotes study that s why we adopt it returned Laurie who certainly could not be accused of vanity having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for quarter inch long stubble By the way Jo I think that little Parker is really getting desperate about Amy He talks of her constantly writes poetry and moons about in a most suspicious manner He d better nip his little passion in the bud hadn t he added Laurie in a confidential elder brotherly tone after a minute s silence Of course he had We don t want any more marrying in this family for years to come Mercy on us what are the children thinking of and Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in their teens It s a fast age and I don t know what we are coming to ma am You are a mere infant but you ll go next Jo and we ll be left lamenting said Laurie shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times Don t be alarmed I m not one of the agreeable sort Nobody will want me and it s a mercy for there should always be one old maid in a family You won t give anyone a chance said Laurie with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face You won t show the soft side of your character and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and can t help showing that he likes it you treat him as Mrs Gummidge did her sweetheart throw cold water over him and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you I don t like that sort of thing I m too busy to be worried with nonsense and I think it s dreadful to break up families so Now don t say any more about it Meg s wedding has turned all our heads and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities I don t wish to get cross so let s change the subject and Jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation Whatever his feelings might have been Laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate Mark my words Jo you ll go next CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE FIRST WEDDING The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine like friendly little neighbors as they were Quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces as they swung in the wind whispering to one another what they had seen for some peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden porch and hall and all from the rosiest full blown flower to the palest baby bud offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long Meg looked very like a rose herself for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day making it fair and tender with a charm more beautiful than beauty Neither silk lace nor orange flowers would she have I don t want a fashionable wedding but only those about me whom I love and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self So she made her wedding gown herself sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart Her sisters braided up her pretty hair and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley which her John liked best of all the flowers that grew You do look just like our own dear Meg only so very sweet and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn t crumple your dress cried Amy surveying her with delight when all was done Then I am satisfied But please hug and kiss me everyone and don t mind my dress I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today and Meg opened her arms to her sisters who clung about her with April faces for a minute feeling that the new love had not changed the old Now I m going to tie John s cravat for him and then to stay a few minutes with Father quietly in the study and Meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies and then to follow her mother wherever she went conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest As the younger girls stand together giving the last touches to their simple toilet it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance for all are looking their best just now Jo s angles are much softened she has learned to carry herself with ease if not grace The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks a soft shine in her eyes and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today Beth has grown slender pale and more quiet than ever The beautiful kind eyes are larger and in them lies an expression that saddens one although it is not sad itself It is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of being better soon Amy is with truth considered the flower of the family for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a full grown woman not beautiful but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace One saw it in the lines of her figure the make and motion of her hands the flow of her dress the droop of her hair unconscious yet harmonious and as attractive to many as beauty itself Amy s nose still afflicted her for it never would grow Grecian so did her mouth being too wide and having a decided chin These offending features gave character to her whole face but she never could see it and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion keen blue eyes and curls more golden and abundant than ever All three wore suits of thin silver gray their best gowns for the summer with blush roses in hair and bosom and all three looked just what they were fresh faced happy hearted girls pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood There were to be no ceremonious performances everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible so when Aunt March arrived she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm Upon my word here s a state of things cried the old lady taking the seat of honor prepared for her and settling the folds of her lavender moire with a great rustle You oughtn t to be seen till the last minute child I m not a show Aunty and no one is coming to stare at me to criticize my dress or count the cost of my luncheon I m too happy to care what anyone says or thinks and I m going to have my little wedding just as I like it John dear here s your hammer And away went Meg to help that man in his highly improper employment Mr Brooke didn t even say Thank you but as he stooped for the unromantic tool he kissed his little bride behind the folding door with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes A crash a cry and a laugh from Laurie accompanied by the indecorous exclamation Jupiter Ammon Jo s upset the cake again caused a momentary flurry which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived and the party came in as Beth used to say when a child Don t let that young giant come near me he worries me worse than mosquitoes whispered the old lady to Amy as the rooms filled and Laurie s black head towered above the rest He has promised to be very good today and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes returned Amy and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware of the dragon which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her There was no bridal procession but a sudden silence fell upon the room as Mr March and the young couple took their places under the green arch Mother and sisters gathered close as if loath to give Meg up The fatherly voice broke more than once which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn The bridegroom s hand trembled visibly and no one heard his replies But Meg looked straight up in her husband s eyes and said I will with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mother s heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly Jo did not cry though she was very near it once and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring fixedly at her with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes Beth kept her face hidden on her mother s shoulder but Amy stood like a graceful statue with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair It wasn t at all the thing I m afraid but the minute she was fairly married Meg cried The first kiss for Marmee and turning gave it with her heart on her lips During the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever for everyone availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent from Mr Laurence to old Hannah who adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made fell upon her in the hall crying with a sob and a chuckle Bless you deary a hundred times The cake ain t hurt a mite and everything looks lovely Everybody cleared up after that and said something brilliant or tried to which did just as well for laughter is ready when hearts are light There was no display of gifts for they were already in the little house nor was there an elaborate breakfast but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit dressed with flowers Mr Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when water lemonade and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried round No one said anything till Laurie who insisted on serving the bride appeared before her with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident he whispered or am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this morning No your grandfather kindly offered us his best and Aunt March actually sent some but Father put away a little for Beth and dispatched the rest to the Soldier s Home You know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness and Mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh but he did neither for after a quick look at her he said in his impetuous way I like that For I ve seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do You are not made wise by experience I hope and there was an anxious accent in Meg s voice No I give you my word for it Don t think too well of me either this is not one of my temptations Being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless I don t care for it but when a pretty girl offers it one doesn t like to refuse you see But you will for the sake of others if not for your own Come Laurie promise and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment for ridicule is often harder to bear than self denial Meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs and feeling her power used it as a woman may for her friend s good She did not speak but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness and a smile which said No one can refuse me anything today Laurie certainly could not and with an answering smile he gave her his hand saying heartily I promise Mrs Brooke I thank you very very much And I drink long life to your resolution Teddy cried Jo baptizing him with a splash of lemonade as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him So the toast was drunk the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations for with instinctive wisdom the girls seized a happy moment to do their friend a service for which he thanked them all his life After lunch people strolled about by twos and threes through the house and garden enjoying the sunshine without and within Meg and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding All the married people take hands and dance round the new made husband and wife as the Germans do while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside cried Laurie promenading down the path with Amy with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur Mr and Mrs March Aunt and Uncle Carrol began it others rapidly joined in even Sallie Moffat after a moment s hesitation threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into the ring But the crowning joke was Mr Laurence and Aunt March for when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady she just tucked her cane under her arm and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close and then people began to go I wish you well my dear I heartily wish you well but I think you ll be sorry for it said Aunt March to Meg adding to the bridegroom as he led her to the carriage You ve got a treasure young man see that you deserve it That is the prettiest wedding I ve been to for an age Ned and I don t see why for there wasn t a bit of style about it observed Mrs Moffat to her husband as they drove away Laurie my lad if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing get one of those little girls to help you and I shall be perfectly satisfied said Mr Laurence settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning I ll do my best to gratify you Sir was Laurie s unusually dutiful reply as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole The little house was not far away and the only bridal journey Meg had was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new When she came down looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove colored suit and straw bonnet tied with white they all gathered about her to say good by as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour Don t feel that I am separated from you Marmee dear or that I love you any the less for loving John so much she said clinging to her mother with full eyes for a moment I shall come every day Father and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts though I am married Beth is going to be with me a great de
