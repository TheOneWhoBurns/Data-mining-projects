latest celebrity who has arrived Ristori or Dickens Victor Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands The equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention especially the low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves with a pair of dashing ponies gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles and little grooms on the perch behind Along this walk on Christmas Day a tall young man walked slowly with his hands behind him and a somewhat absent expression of countenance He looked like an Italian was dressed like an Englishman and had the independent air of an American a combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him and sundry dandies in black velvet suits with rose colored neckties buff gloves and orange flowers in their buttonholes to shrug their shoulders and then envy him his inches There were plenty of pretty faces to admire but the young man took little notice of them except to glance now and then at some blonde girl in blue Presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin Publique or to wander along the beach toward Castle Hill The quick trot of ponies feet made him look up as one of the little carriages containing a single young lady came rapidly down the street The lady was young blonde and dressed in blue He stared a minute then his whole face woke up and waving his hat like a boy he hurried forward to meet her Oh Laurie is it really you I thought you d never come cried Amy dropping the reins and holding out both hands to the great scandalization of a French mamma who hastened her daughter s steps lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these mad English I was detained by the way but I promised to spend Christmas with you and here I am How is your grandfather When did you come Where are you staying Very well last night at the Chauvain I called at your hotel but you were out I have so much to say I don t know where to begin Get in and we can talk at our ease I was going for a drive and longing for company Flo s saving up for tonight What happens then a ball A Christmas party at our hotel There are many Americans there and they give it in honor of the day You ll go with us of course Aunt will be charmed Thank you Where now asked Laurie leaning back and folding his arms a proceeding which suited Amy who preferred to drive for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies backs afforded her infinite satisfaction I m going to the bankers first for letters and then to Castle Hill The view is so lovely and I like to feed the peacocks Have you ever been there Often years ago but I don t mind having a look at it Now tell me all about yourself The last I heard of you your grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin Yes I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris where he has settled for the winter He has friends there and finds plenty to amuse him so I go and come and we get on capitally That s a sociable arrangement said Amy missing something in Laurie s manner though she couldn t tell what Why you see he hates to travel and I hate to keep still so we each suit ourselves and there is no trouble I am often with him and he enjoys my adventures while I like to feel that someone is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings Dirty old hole isn t it he added with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city The dirt is picturesque so I don t mind The river and the hills are delicious and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my delight Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass It s going to the Church of St John While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies white veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked Amy watched him and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her for he was changed and she could not find the merry faced boy she left in the moody looking man beside her He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved she thought but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over he looked tired and spiritless not sick nor exactly unhappy but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him She couldn t understand it and did not venture to ask questions so she shook her head and touched up her ponies as the procession wound away across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church Que pensez vous she said airing her French which had improved in quantity if not in quality since she came abroad That mademoiselle has made good use of her time and the result is charming replied Laurie bowing with his hand on his heart and an admiring look She blushed with pleasure but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home when he promenaded round her on festival occasions and told her she was altogether jolly with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head She didn t like the new tone for though not blase it sounded indifferent in spite of the look If that s the way he s going to grow up I wish he d stay a boy she thought with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay At Avigdor s she found the precious home letters and giving the reins to Laurie read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June Beth is very poorly Mother says I often think I ought to go home but they all say stay So I do for I shall never have another chance like this said Amy looking sober over one page I think you are right there You could do nothing at home and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy and enjoying so much my dear He drew a little nearer and looked more like his old self as he said that and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy s heart was lightened for the look the act the brotherly my dear seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come she would not be alone in a strange land Presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap and issuing from her mouth the words Genius burns Laurie smiled took it put it in his vest pocket to keep it from blowing away and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read him This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me with presents in the morning you and letters in the afternoon and a party at night said Amy as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them tamely waiting to be fed While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought He found nothing to perplex or disappoint much to admire and approve for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner she was as sprightly and graceful as ever with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance Always mature for her age she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was but her old petulance now and then showed itself her strong will still held its own and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign polish Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him and carried away a pretty little picture of a bright faced girl standing in the sunshine which brought out the soft hue of her dress the fresh color of her cheeks the golden gloss of her hair and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill Amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt and said pointing here and there Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay and the lovely road to Villa Franca Schubert s Tower just below and best of all that speck far out to sea which they say is Corsica I remember It s not much changed he answered without enthusiasm What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck said Amy feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also Yes was all he said but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting in his sight Take a good look at it for her sake and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while said Amy seating herself ready for a good talk But she did not get it for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely she could only learn that he had roved about the Continent and been to Greece So after idling away an hour they drove home again and having paid his respects to Mrs Carrol Laurie left them promising to return in the evening It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night Time and absence had done its work on both the young people She had seen her old friend in a new light not as our boy but as a handsome and agreeable man and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight Amy knew her good points and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions and following the sensible English fashion of simple dress for young girls got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers a few trinkets and all manner of dainty devices which were both inexpensive and effective It must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman and indulged in antique coiffures statuesque attitudes and classic draperies But dear heart we all have our little weaknesses and find it easy to pardon such in the young who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities I do want him to think I look well and tell them so at home said Amy to herself as she put on Flo s old white silk ball dress and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect Her hair she had the sense to let alone after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a Hebe like knot at the back of her head It s not the fashion but it s becoming and I can t afford to make a fright of myself she used to say when advised to frizzle puff or braid as the latest style commanded Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion Amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines Remembering the painted boots she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction and chasseed down the room admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself My new fan just matches my flowers my gloves fit to a charm and the real lace on Aunt s mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress If I only had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy she said surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand In spite of this affliction she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away She seldom ran it did not suit her style she thought for being tall the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante She walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for Laurie and once arranged herself under the chandelier which had a good effect upon her hair then she thought better of it and went away to the other end of the room as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one It so happened that she could not have done a better thing for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him and as she stood at the distant window with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress the slender white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a well placed statue Good evening Diana said Laurie with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her Good evening Apollo she answered smiling back at him for he too looked unusually debonair and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart Here are your flowers I arranged them myself remembering that you didn t like what Hannah calls a sot bookay said Laurie handing her a delicate nosegay in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in Cardiglia s window How kind you are she exclaimed gratefully If I d known you were coming I d have had something ready for you today though not as pretty as this I m afraid Thank you It isn t what it should be but you have improved it he added as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist Please don t I thought you liked that sort of thing Not from you it doesn t sound natural and I like your old bluntness better I m glad of it he answered with a look of relief then buttoned her gloves for her and asked if his tie was straight just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home The company assembled in the long salle a manger that evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent The hospitable Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice and having no prejudice against titles secured a few to add luster to their Christmas ball A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady dressed like Hamlet s mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin A Polish count aged eighteen devoted himself to the ladies who pronounced him a fascinating dear and a German Serene Something having come to supper alone roamed vaguely about seeking what he might devour Baron Rothschild s private secretary a large nosed Jew in tight boots affably beamed upon the world as if his master s name crowned him with a golden halo A stout Frenchman who knew the Emperor came to indulge his mania for dancing and Lady de Jones a British matron adorned the scene with her little family of eight Of course there were many light footed shrill voiced American girls handsome lifeless looking English ditto and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters Any young girl can imagine Amy s state of mind when she took the stage that night leaning on Laurie s arm She knew she looked well she loved to dance she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty youth and womanhood She did pity the Davis girls who were awkward plain and destitute of escort except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed which was good of her as it permitted them to see her dress and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished looking friend might be With the first burst of the band Amy s color rose her eyes began to sparkle and her feet to tap the floor impatiently for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know it Therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone Do you care to dance One usually does at a ball Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as fast as possible I meant the first dance May I have the honor I can give you one if I put off the Count He dances divinely but he will excuse me as you are an old friend said Amy hoping that the name would have a good effect and show Laurie that she was not to be trifled with Nice little boy but rather a short Pole to support A daughter of the gods Devinely tall and most divinely fair was all the satisfaction she got however The set in which they found themselves was composed of English and Amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish Laurie resigned her to the nice little boy and went to do his duty to Flo without securing Amy for the joys to come which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished for she immediately engaged herself till supper meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence She showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next a glorious polka redowa But his polite regrets didn t impose upon her and when she galloped away with the Count she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief That was unpardonable and Amy took no more notice of him for a long while except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moment s rest Her anger had a good effect however for she hid it under a smiling face and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant Laurie s eyes followed her with pleasure for she neither romped nor sauntered but danced with spirit and grace making the delightsome pastime what it should be He very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view and before the evening was half over had decided that little Amy was going to make a very charming woman It was a lively scene for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone and Christmas merriment made all faces shine hearts happy and heels light The musicians fiddled tooted and banged as if they enjoyed it everybody danced who could and those who couldn t admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth The air was dark with Davises and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young giraffes The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing French woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train The serene Teuton found the supper table and was happy eating steadily through the bill of fare and dismayed the garcons by the ravages he committed But the Emperor s friend covered himself with glory for he danced everything whether he knew it or not and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him The boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold for though he carried weight he danced like an India rubber ball He ran he flew he pranced his face glowed his bald head shown his coattails waved wildly his pumps actually twinkled in the air and when the music stopped he wiped the drops from his brow and beamed upon his fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged When little Vladimir finally relinquished her with assurances that he was desolated to leave so early she was ready to rest and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment It had been successful for at three and twenty blighted affections find a balm in friendly society and young nerves will thrill young blood dance and healthy young spirits rise when subjected to the enchantment of beauty light music and motion Laurie had a waked up look as he rose to give her his seat and when he hurried away to bring her some supper she said to herself with a satisfied smile Ah I thought that would do him good You look like Balzac s Femme Peinte Par Elle Meme he said as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other My rouge won t come off and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright What do you call this stuff he asked touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee Illusion Good name for it It s very pretty new thing isn t it It s as old as the hills You have seen it on dozens of girls and you never found out that it was pretty till now stupide I never saw it on you before which accounts for the mistake you see None of that it is forbidden I d rather take coffee than compliments just now No don t lounge it makes me nervous Laurie sat bold upright and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having little Amy order him about for she had lost her shyness now and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection Where did you learn all this sort of thing he asked with a quizzical look As this sort of thing is rather a vague expression would you kindly explain returned Amy knowing perfectly well what he meant but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable Well the general air the style the self possession the the illusion you know laughed Laurie breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word Amy was gratified but of course didn t show it and demurely answered Foreign life polishes one in spite of one s self I study as well as play and as for this with a little gesture toward her dress why tulle is cheap posies to be had for nothing and I am used to making the most of my poor little things Amy rather regretted that last sentence fearing it wasn t in good taste but Laurie liked her better for it and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly nor why he filled up her book with his own name and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT ON THE SHELF In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married when Vive la liberte becomes their motto In America as everyone knows girls early sign the declaration of independence and enjoy their freedom with republican zest but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a French nunnery though by no means as quiet Whether they like it or not they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over and most of them might exclaim as did a very pretty woman the other day I m as handsome as ever but no one takes any notice of me because I m married Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady Meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old for in her little world primitive customs prevailed and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever As she was a womanly little woman the maternal instinct was very strong and she was entirely absorbed in her children to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else Day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety leaving John to the tender mercies of the help for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen department Being a domestic man John decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive but as he adored his babies he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored But three months passed and there was no return of repose Meg looked worn and nervous the babies absorbed every minute of her time the house was neglected and Kitty the cook who took life aisy kept him on short commons When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma if he came gaily in at night eager to embrace his family he was quenched by a Hush They are just asleep after worrying all day If he proposed a little amusement at home No it would disturb the babies If he hinted at a lecture or a concert he was answered with a reproachful look and a decided Leave my children for pleasure never His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night His meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius who deserted him half helped if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above And when he read his paper of an evening Demi s colic got into the shipping list and Daisy s fall affected the price of stocks for Mrs Brooke was only interested in domestic news The poor man was very uncomfortable for the children had bereft him of his wife home was merely a nursery and the perpetual hushing made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of Babyland He bore it very patiently for six months and when no signs of amendment appeared he did what other paternal exiles do tried to get a little comfort elsewhere Scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off and John fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening when his own parlor was empty and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end Mrs Scott was a lively pretty girl with nothing to do but be agreeable and she performed her mission most successfully The parlor was always bright and attractive the chessboard ready the piano in tune plenty of gay gossip and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his neighbor s society Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first and found it a relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor or tramping about the house and waking the children But by and by when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours leaving Mamma time to rest she began to miss John and find her workbasket dull company when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender She would not ask him to stay at home but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness and too much devotion to that idol of American women the teapot makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle Yes she would say looking in the glass I m getting old and ugly John doesn t find me interesting any longer so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor who has no incumbrances Well the babies love me they don t care if I am thin and pale and haven t time to crimp my hair they are my comfort and some day John will see what I ve gladly sacrificed for them won t he my precious To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo or Demi with a crow and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel which soothed her solitude for the time being But the pain increased as politics absorbed John who was always running over to discuss interesting points with Scott quite unconscious that Meg missed him Not a word did she say however till her mother found her in tears one day and insisted on knowing what the matter was for Meg s drooping spirits had not escaped her observation I wouldn t tell anyone except you Mother but I really do need advice for if John goes on much longer I might as well be widowed replied Mrs Brooke drying her tears on Daisy s bib with an injured air Goes on how my dear asked her mother anxiously He s away all day and at night when I want to see him he is continually going over to the Scotts It isn t fair that I should have the hardest work and never any amusement Men are very selfish even the best of them So are women Don t blame John till you see where you are wrong yourself But it can t be right for him to neglect me Don t you neglect him Why Mother I thought you d take my part So I do as far as sympathizing goes but I think the fault is yours Meg I don t see how Let me show you Did John ever neglect you as you call it while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening his only leisure time No but I can t do it now with two babies to tend I think you could dear and I think you ought May I speak quite freely and will you remember that it s Mother who blames as well as Mother who sympathizes Indeed I will Speak to me as if I were little Meg again I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything Meg drew her low chair beside her mother s and with a little interruption in either lap the two women rocked and talked lovingly together feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever You have only made the mistake that most young wives make forgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your children A very natural and forgivable mistake Meg but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways for children should draw you nearer than ever not separate you as if they were all yours and John had nothing to do but support them I ve seen it for some weeks but have not spoken feeling sure it would come right in time I m afraid it won t If I ask him to stay he ll think I m jealous and I wouldn t insult him by such an idea He doesn t see that I want him and I don t know how to tell him without words Make it so pleasant he won t want to go away My dear he s longing for his little home but it isn t home without you and you are always in the nursery Oughtn t I to be there Not all the time too much confinement makes you nervous and then you are unfitted for everything Besides you owe something to John as well as to the babies Don t neglect husband for children don t shut him out of the nursery but teach him how to help in it His place is there as well as yours and the children need him Let him feel that he has a part to do and he will do it gladly and faithfully and it will be better for you all You really think so Mother I know it Meg for I ve tried it and I seldom give advice unless I ve proved its practicability When you and Jo were little I went on just as you are feeling as if I didn t do my duty unless I devoted myself wholly to you Poor Father took to his books after I had refused all offers of help and left me to try my experiment alone I struggled along as well as I could but Jo was too much for me I nearly spoiled her by indulgence You were poorly and I worried about you till I fell sick myself Then Father came to the rescue quietly managed everything and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake and never have been able to get on without him since That is the secret of our home happiness He does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all and I try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits Each do our part alone in many things but at home we work together always It is so Mother and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours Show me how I ll do anything you say You always were my docile daughter Well dear if I were you I d let John have more to do with the management of Demi for the boy needs training and it s none too soon to begin Then I d do what I have often proposed let Hannah come and help you She is a capital nurse and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework You need the exercise Hannah would enjoy the rest and John would find his wife again Go out more keep cheerful as well as busy for you are the sunshine maker of the family and if you get dismal there is no fair weather Then I d try to take an interest in whatever John likes talk with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way Don t shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman but understand what is going on and educate yourself to take your part in the world s work for it all affects you and yours John is so sensible I m afraid he will think I m stupid if I ask questions about politics and things I don t believe he would Love covers a multitude of sins and of whom could you ask more freely than of him Try it and see if he doesn t find your society far more agreeable than Mrs Scott s suppers I will Poor John I m afraid I have neglected him sadly but I thought I was right and he never said anything He tried not to be selfish but he has felt rather forlorn I fancy This is just the time Meg when young married people are apt to grow apart and the very time when they ought to be most together for the first tenderness soon wears off unless care is taken to preserve it And no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train Don t let John be a stranger to the babies for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should Now dear good by Think over Mother s preachment act upon it if it seems good and God bless you all Meg did think it over found it good and acted upon it though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it Of course the children tyrannized over her and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices but Papa was not so easily subjugated and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son For Demi inherited a trifle of his sire s firmness of character we won t call it obstinacy and when he made up his little mind to have or to do anything all the king s horses and all the king s men could not change that pertinacious little mind Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices but Papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience So Master Demi early discovered that when he undertook to wrastle with Parpar he always got the worst of it yet like the Englishman baby respected the man who conquered him and loved the father whose grave No no was more impressive than all Mamma s love pats A few days after the talk with her mother Meg resolved to try a social evening with John so she ordered a nice supper set the parlor in order dressed herself prettily and put the children to bed early that nothing should interfere with her experiment But unfortunately Demi s most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed and that night he decided to go on a rampage So poor Meg sang and rocked told stories and tried every sleep prevoking wile she could devise but all in vain the big eyes wouldn t shut and long after Daisy had gone to byelow like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was naughty Demi lay staring at the light with the most discouragingly wide awake expression of countenance Will Demi lie still like a good boy while Mamma runs down and gives poor Papa his tea asked Meg as the hall door softly closed and the well known step went tip toeing into the dining room Me has tea said Demi preparing to join in the revel No but I ll save you some little cakies for breakfast if you ll go bye bye like Daisy Will you lovey Iss and Demi shut his eyes tight as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day Taking advantage of the propitious moment Meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration He saw it at once and said with pleased surprise Why little mother how gay we are tonight Do you expect company Only you dear Is it a birthday anniversary or anything No I m tired of being dowdy so I dressed up as a change You always make yourself nice for table no matter how tired you are so why shouldn t I when I have the time I do it out of respect for you my dear said old fashioned John Ditto ditto Mr Brooke laughed Meg looking young and pretty again as she nodded to him over the teapot Well it s altogether delightful and like old times This tastes right I drink your health dear and John sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture which was of very short duration however for as he put down his cup the door handle rattled mysteriously and a little voice was heard saying impatiently Opy doy Me s tummin It s that naughty boy I told him to go to sleep alone and here he is downstairs getting his death a cold pattering over that canvas said Meg answering the call Mornin now announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table eyeing the cakies with loving glances No it isn t morning yet You must go to bed and not trouble poor Mamma Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it Me loves Parpar said the artful one preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys But John shook his head and said to Meg If you told him to stay up there and go to sleep alone make him do it or he will never learn to mind you Yes of course Come Demi and Meg led her son away feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery Nor was he disappointed for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar tucked him into his bed and forbade any more promenades till morning Iss said Demi the perjured blissfully sucking his sugar and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful Meg returned to her place and supper was progressing pleasantly when the little ghost walked again and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding More sudar Marmar Now this won t do said John hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner We shall never know any peace till that child learns to go to bed properly You have made a slave of yourself long enough Give him one lesson and then there will be an end of it Put him in his bed and leave him Meg He won t stay there he never does unless I sit by him I ll manage him Demi go upstairs and get into your bed as Mamma bids you S ant replied the young rebel helping himself to the coveted cakie and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity You must never say that to Papa I shall carry you if you don t go yourself Go way me don t love Parpar and Demi retired to his mother s skirts for protection But even that refuge proved unavailing for he was delivered over to the enemy with a Be gentle with him John which struck the culprit with dismay for when Mamma deserted him then the judgment day was at hand Bereft of his cake defrauded of his frolic and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed poor Demi could not restrain his wrath but openly defied Papa and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs The minute he was put into bed on one side he rolled out on the other and made for the door only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again which lively performance was kept up till the young man s strength gave out when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice This vocal exercise usually conquered Meg but John sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf No coaxing no sugar no lullaby no story even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the big dark which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear This new order of things disgusted him and he howled dismally for Marmar as his angry passions subsided and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg s heart and she ran up to say beseechingly Let me stay with him he ll be good now John No my dear I ve told him he must go to sleep as you bid him and he must if I stay here all night But he ll cry himself sick pleaded Meg reproaching herself for deserting her boy No he won t he s so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled for he will understand that he has got to mind Don t interfere I ll manage him He s my child and I can t have his spirit broken by harshness He s my child and I won t have his temper spoiled by indulgence Go down my dear and leave the boy to me When John spoke in that masterful tone Meg always obeyed and never regretted her docility Please let me kiss him once John Certainly Demi say good night to Mamma and let her go and rest for she is very tired with taking care of you all day Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory for after it was given Demi sobbed more quietly and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind Poor little man he s worn out with sleep and crying I ll cover him up and then go and set Meg s heart at rest thought John creeping to the bedside hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep But he wasn t for the moment his father peeped at him Demi s eyes opened his little chin began to quiver and he put up his arms saying with a penitent hiccough Me s dood now Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest Demi lay fast asleep not in his usual spreadeagle attitude but in a subdued bunch cuddled close in the circle of his father s arm and holding his father s finger as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby So held John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold and while waiting had fallen asleep more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole day s work As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow she smiled to herself and then slipped away again saying in a satisfied tone I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies He does know how to manage them and will be a great help for Demi is getting too much for me When John came down at last expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a bonnet and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election if he was not too tired John saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on but wisely asked no questions knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person she couldn t keep a secret to save her life and therefore the clue would soon appear He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner while Meg tried to look deeply interested to ask intelligent questions and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet In her secret soul however she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names but she kept these feminine ideas to herself and when John paused shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity Well I really don t see what we are coming to John laughed and watched her for a minute as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken She is trying to like politics for my sake so I ll try and like millinery for hers that s only fair thought John the Just adding aloud That s very pretty Is it what you call a breakfast cap My dear man it s a bonnet My very best go to concert and theater bonnet I beg your pardon it was so small I naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear How do you keep it on These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud so and Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible It s a love of a bonnet but I prefer the face inside for it looks young and happy again and John kissed the smiling face to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin I m glad you like it for I want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night I really need some music to put me in tune Will you please Of course I will with all my heart or anywhere else you like You have been shut up so long it will do you no end of good and I shall enjoy it of all things What put it into your head little mother Well I had a talk with Marmee the other day and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt and she said I needed change and less care so Hannah is to help me with the children and I m to see to things about the house more and now and then have a little fun just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety broken down old woman before my time It s only an experiment John and I want to try it for your sake as much as for mine because I ve neglected you shamefully lately and I m going to make home what it used to be if I can You don t object I hope Never mind what John said or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin All that we have any business to know is that John did not appear to object judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates It was not all Paradise by any means but everyone was better for the division of labor system The children throve under the paternal rule for accurate steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom while Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome exercise a little pleasure and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband Home grew homelike again and John had no wish to leave it unless he took Meg with him The Scotts came to the Brookes now and everyone found the little house a cheerful place full of happiness content and family love Even Sallie Moffatt liked to go there It is always so quiet and pleasant here it does me good Meg she used to say looking about her with wistful eyes as if trying to discover the charm that she might use it in her great house full of splendid loneliness for there were no riotous sunny faced babies there and Ned lived in a world of his own where there was no place for her This household happiness did not come all at once but John and Meg had found the key to it and each year of married life taught them how to use it unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness which the poorest may possess and the richest cannot buy This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid safe from the restless fret and fever of the world finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them undaunted by sorrow poverty or age walking side by side through fair and stormy weather with a faithful friend who is in the true sense of the good old Saxon word the house band and learning as Meg learned that a woman s happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother CHAPTER THIRTY NINE LAZY LAURENCE Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week and remained a month He was tired of wandering about alone and Amy s familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part He rather missed the petting he used to receive and enjoyed a taste of it again for no attentions however flattering from strangers were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home Amy never would pet him like the others but she was very glad to see him now and quite clung to him feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess They naturally took comfort in each other s society and were much together riding walking dancing or dawdling for at Nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season But while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion they were half consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each other Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend but he sank in hers and each felt the truth before a word was spoken Amy tried to please and succeeded for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm Laurie made no effort of any kind but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible trying to forget and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him It cost him no effort to be generous and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have taken them but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half sorrowful half scornful surprise All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day I preferred to stay at home and write letters They are done now and I am going to Valrosa to sketch wi
