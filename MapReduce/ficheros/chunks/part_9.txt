t and likes brown eyes and doesn t think John an ugly name and she ll go and fall in love and there s an end of peace and fun and cozy times together I see it all They ll go lovering around the house and we shall have to dodge Meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow carry her off and make a hole in the family and I shall break my heart and everything will be abominably uncomfortable Oh dear me Why weren t we all boys then there wouldn t be any bother Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible John Mrs March sighed and Jo looked up with an air of relief You don t like it Mother I m glad of it Let s send him about his business and not tell Meg a word of it but all be happy together as we always have been I did wrong to sigh Jo It is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time but I do want to keep my girls as long as I can and I am sorry that this happened so soon for Meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for her Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way nor be married before twenty If she and John love one another they can wait and test the love by doing so She is conscientious and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly My pretty tender hearted girl I hope things will go happily with her Hadn t you rather have her marry a rich man asked Jo as her mother s voice faltered a little over the last words Money is a good and useful thing Jo and I hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly nor be tempted by too much I should like to know that John was firmly established in some good business which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable I m not ambitious for a splendid fortune a fashionable position or a great name for my girls If rank and money come with love and virtue also I should accept them gratefully and enjoy your good fortune but I know by experience how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house where the daily bread is earned and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures I am content to see Meg begin humbly for if I am not mistaken she will be rich in the possession of a good man s heart and that is better than a fortune I understand Mother and quite agree but I m disappointed about Meg for I d planned to have her marry Teddy by and by and sit in the lap of luxury all her days Wouldn t it be nice asked Jo looking up with a brighter face He is younger than she you know began Mrs March but Jo broke in Only a little he s old for his age and tall and can be quite grown up in his manners if he likes Then he s rich and generous and good and loves us all and I say it s a pity my plan is spoiled I m afraid Laurie is hardly grown up enough for Meg and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on Don t make plans Jo but let time and their own hearts mate your friends We can t meddle safely in such matters and had better not get romantic rubbish as you call it into our heads lest it spoil our friendship Well I won t but I hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up when a pull here and a snip there would straighten it out I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up But buds will be roses and kittens cats more s the pity What s that about flatirons and cats asked Meg as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand Only one of my stupid speeches I m going to bed Come Peggy said Jo unfolding herself like an animated puzzle Quite right and beautifully written Please add that I send my love to John said Mrs March as she glanced over the letter and gave it back Do you call him John asked Meg smiling with her innocent eyes looking down into her mother s Yes he has been like a son to us and we are very fond of him replied Mrs March returning the look with a keen one I m glad of that he is so lonely Good night Mother dear It is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here was Meg s answer The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one and as she went away Mrs March said with a mixture of satisfaction and regret She does not love John yet but will soon learn to CHAPTER TWENTY ONE LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF AND JO MAKES PEACE Jo s face was a study next day for the secret rather weighed upon her and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important Meg observed it but did not trouble herself to make inquiries for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask She was rather surprised therefore when the silence remained unbroken and Jo assumed a patronizing air which decidedly aggravated Meg who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother This left Jo to her own devices for Mrs March had taken her place as nurse and bade her rest exercise and amuse herself after her long confinement Amy being gone Laurie was her only refuge and much as she enjoyed his society she rather dreaded him just then for he was an incorrigible tease and she feared he would coax the secret from her She was quite right for the mischief loving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out and led Jo a trying life of it He wheedled bribed ridiculed threatened and scolded affected indifference that he might surprise the truth from her declared he knew then that he didn t care and at last by dint of perseverance he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr Brooke Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor s confidence he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her father s return but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her and for a day or two she was quite unlike herself She started when spoken to blushed when looked at was very quiet and sat over her sewing with a timid troubled look on her face To her mother s inquiries she answered that she was quite well and Jo s she silenced by begging to be let alone She feels it in the air love I mean and she s going very fast She s got most of the symptoms is twittery and cross doesn t eat lies awake and mopes in corners I caught her singing that song he gave her and once she said John as you do and then turned as red as a poppy Whatever shall we do said Jo looking ready for any measures however violent Nothing but wait Let her alone be kind and patient and Father s coming will settle everything replied her mother Here s a note to you Meg all sealed up How odd Teddy never seals mine said Jo next day as she distributed the contents of the little post office Mrs March and Jo were deep in their own affairs when a sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face My child what is it cried her mother running to her while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief It s all a mistake he didn t send it Oh Jo how could you do it and Meg hid her face in her hands crying as if her heart were quite broken Me I ve done nothing What s she talking about cried Jo bewildered Meg s mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at Jo saying reproachfully You wrote it and that bad boy helped you How could you be so rude so mean and cruel to us both Jo hardly heard her for she and her mother were reading the note which was written in a peculiar hand My Dearest Margaret I can no longer restrain my passion and must know my fate before I return I dare not tell your parents yet but I think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another Mr Laurence will help me to some good place and then my sweet girl you will make me happy I implore you to say nothing to your family yet but to send one word of hope through Laurie to Your devoted John Oh the little villain That s the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to Mother I ll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon cried Jo burning to execute immediate justice But her mother held her back saying with a look she seldom wore Stop Jo you must clear yourself first You have played so many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this On my word Mother I haven t I never saw that note before and don t know anything about it as true as I live said Jo so earnestly that they believed her If I had taken part in it I d have done it better than this and have written a sensible note I should think you d have known Mr Brooke wouldn t write such stuff as that she added scornfully tossing down the paper It s like his writing faltered Meg comparing it with the note in her hand Oh Meg you didn t answer it cried Mrs March quickly Yes I did and Meg hid her face again overcome with shame Here s a scrape Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured I can t rest till I get hold of him And Jo made for the door again Hush Let me handle this for it is worse than I thought Margaret tell me the whole story commanded Mrs March sitting down by Meg yet keeping hold of Jo lest she should fly off I received the first letter from Laurie who didn t look as if he knew anything about it began Meg without looking up I was worried at first and meant to tell you then I remembered how you liked Mr Brooke so I thought you wouldn t mind if I kept my little secret for a few days I m so silly that I liked to think no one knew and while I was deciding what to say I felt like the girls in books who have such things to do Forgive me Mother I m paid for my silliness now I never can look him in the face again What did you say to him asked Mrs March I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet that I didn t wish to have secrets from you and he must speak to father I was very grateful for his kindness and would be his friend but nothing more for a long while Mrs March smiled as if well pleased and Jo clapped her hands exclaiming with a laugh You are almost equal to Caroline Percy who was a pattern of prudence Tell on Meg What did he say to that He writes in a different way entirely telling me that he never sent any love letter at all and is very sorry that my roguish sister Jo should take liberties with our names It s very kind and respectful but think how dreadful for me Meg leaned against her mother looking the image of despair and Jo tramped about the room calling Laurie names All of a sudden she stopped caught up the two notes and after looking at them closely said decidedly I don t believe Brooke ever saw either of these letters Teddy wrote both and keeps yours to crow over me with because I wouldn t tell him my secret Don t have any secrets Jo Tell it to Mother and keep out of trouble as I should have done said Meg warningly Bless you child Mother told me That will do Jo I ll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie I shall sift the matter to the bottom and put a stop to such pranks at once Away ran Jo and Mrs March gently told Meg Mr Brooke s real feelings Now dear what are your own Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you or will you keep yourself quite free for the present I ve been so scared and worried I don t want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while perhaps never answered Meg petulantly If John doesn t know anything about this nonsense don t tell him and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues I won t be deceived and plagued and made a fool of It s a shame Seeing Meg s usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke Mrs March soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future The instant Laurie s step was heard in the hall Meg fled into the study and Mrs March received the culprit alone Jo had not told him why he was wanted fearing he wouldn t come but he knew the minute he saw Mrs March s face and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once Jo was dismissed but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel having some fear that the prisoner might bolt The sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour but what happened during that interview the girls never knew When they were called in Laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot but did not think it wise to betray the fact Meg received his humble apology and was much comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke I ll never tell him to my dying day wild horses shan t drag it out of me so you ll forgive me Meg and I ll do anything to show how out and out sorry I am he added looking very much ashamed of himself I ll try but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do I didn t think you could be so sly and malicious Laurie replied Meg trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air It was altogether abominable and I don t deserve to be spoken to for a month but you will though won t you And Laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior Meg pardoned him and Mrs March s grave face relaxed in spite of her efforts to keep sober when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel Jo stood aloof meanwhile trying to harden her heart against him and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation Laurie looked at her once or twice but as she showed no sign of relenting he felt injured and turned his back on her till the others were done with him when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word As soon as he had gone she wished she had been more forgiving and when Meg and her mother went upstairs she felt lonely and longed for Teddy After resisting for some time she yielded to the impulse and armed with a book to return went over to the big house Is Mr Laurence in asked Jo of a housemaid who was coming downstairs Yes Miss but I don t believe he s seeable just yet Why not Is he ill La no Miss but he s had a scene with Mr Laurie who is in one of his tantrums about something which vexes the old gentleman so I dursn t go nigh him Where is Laurie Shut up in his room and he won t answer though I ve been a tapping I don t know what s to become of the dinner for it s ready and there s no one to eat it I ll go and see what the matter is I m not afraid of either of them Up went Jo and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie s little study Stop that or I ll open the door and make you called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone Jo immediately knocked again The door flew open and in she bounced before Laurie could recover from his surprise Seeing that he really was out of temper Jo who knew how to manage him assumed a contrite expression and going artistically down upon her knees said meekly Please forgive me for being so cross I came to make it up and can t go away till I have It s all right Get up and don t be a goose Jo was the cavalier reply to her petition Thank you I will Could I ask what s the matter You don t look exactly easy in your mind I ve been shaken and I won t bear it growled Laurie indignantly Who did it demanded Jo Grandfather If it had been anyone else I d have And the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm That s nothing I often shake you and you don t mind said Jo soothingly Pooh You re a girl and it s fun but I ll allow no man to shake me I don t think anyone would care to try it if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now Why were you treated so Just because I wouldn t say what your mother wanted me for I d promised not to tell and of course I wasn t going to break my word Couldn t you satisfy your grandpa in any other way No he would have the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth I d have told my part of the scrape if I could without bringing Meg in As I couldn t I held my tongue and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me Then I bolted for fear I should forget myself It wasn t nice but he s sorry I know so go down and make up I ll help you Hanged if I do I m not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone just for a bit of a frolic I was sorry about Meg and begged pardon like a man but I won t do it again when I wasn t in the wrong He didn t know that He ought to trust me and not act as if I was a baby It s no use Jo he s got to learn that I m able to take care of myself and don t need anyone s apron string to hold on by What pepper pots you are sighed Jo How do you mean to settle this affair Well he ought to beg pardon and believe me when I say I can t tell him what the fuss s about Bless you He won t do that I won t go down till he does Now Teddy be sensible Let it pass and I ll explain what I can You can t stay here so what s the use of being melodramatic I don t intend to stay here long anyway I ll slip off and take a journey somewhere and when Grandpa misses me he ll come round fast enough I dare say but you ought not to go and worry him Don t preach I ll go to Washington and see Brooke It s gay there and I ll enjoy myself after the troubles What fun you d have I wish I could run off too said Jo forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital Come on then Why not You go and surprise your father and I ll stir up old Brooke It would be a glorious joke Let s do it Jo We ll leave a letter saying we are all right and trot off at once I ve got money enough It will do you good and no harm as you go to your father For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree for wild as the plan was it just suited her She was tired of care and confinement longed for change and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals liberty and fun Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window but they fell on the old house opposite and she shook her head with sorrowful decision If I was a boy we d run away together and have a capital time but as I m a miserable girl I must be proper and stop at home Don t tempt me Teddy it s a crazy plan That s the fun of it began Laurie who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way Hold your tongue cried Jo covering her ears Prunes and prisms are my doom and I may as well make up my mind to it I came here to moralize not to hear things that make me skip to think of I know Meg would wet blanket such a proposal but I thought you had more spirit began Laurie insinuatingly Bad boy be quiet Sit down and think of your own sins don t go making me add to mine If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking will you give up running away asked Jo seriously Yes but you won t do it answered Laurie who wished to make up but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first If I can manage the young one I can the old one muttered Jo as she walked away leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands Come in and Mr Laurence s gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever as Jo tapped at his door It s only me Sir come to return a book she said blandly as she entered Want any more asked the old gentleman looking grim and vexed but trying not to show it Yes please I like old Sam so well I think I ll try the second volume returned Jo hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of Boswell s Johnson as he had recommended that lively work The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed Jo skipped up and sitting on the top step affected to be searching for her book but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit Mr Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind for after taking several brisk turns about the room he faced round on her speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor What has that boy been about Don t try to shield him I know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home I can t get a word from him and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room He did wrong but we forgave him and all promised not to say a word to anyone began Jo reluctantly That won t do He shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls If he s done anything amiss he shall confess beg pardon and be punished Out with it Jo I won t be kept in the dark Mr Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have gladly run away if she could but she was perched aloft on the steps and he stood at the foot a lion in the path so she had to stay and brave it out Indeed Sir I cannot tell Mother forbade it Laurie has confessed asked pardon and been punished quite enough We don t keep silence to shield him but someone else and it will make more trouble if you interfere Please don t It was partly my fault but it s all right now So let s forget it and talk about the Rambler or something pleasant Hang the Rambler Come down and give me your word that this harum scarum boy of mine hasn t done anything ungrateful or impertinent If he has after all your kindness to him I ll thrash him with my own hands The threat sounded awful but did not alarm Jo for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson whatever he might say to the contrary She obediently descended and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or forgetting the truth Hum ha well if the boy held his tongue because he promised and not from obstinacy I ll forgive him He s a stubborn fellow and hard to manage said Mr Laurence rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief So am I but a kind word will govern me when all the king s horses and all the king s men couldn t said Jo trying to say a kind word for her friend who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another You think I m not kind to him hey was the sharp answer Oh dear no Sir You are rather too kind sometimes and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience Don t you think you are Jo was determined to have it out now and tried to look quite placid though she quaked a little after her bold speech To her great relief and surprise the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly You re right girl I am I love the boy but he tries my patience past bearing and I know how it will end if we go on so I ll tell you he ll run away Jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear much restraint and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad Mr Laurence s ruddy face changed suddenly and he sat down with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man which hung over his table It was Laurie s father who had run away in his youth and married against the imperious old man s will Jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past and she wished she had held her tongue He won t do it unless he is very much worried and only threatens it sometimes when he gets tired of studying I often think I should like to especially since my hair was cut so if you ever miss us you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India She laughed as she spoke and Mr Laurence looked relieved evidently taking the whole as a joke You hussy how dare you talk in that way Where s your respect for me and your proper bringing up Bless the boys and girls What torments they are yet we can t do without them he said pinching her cheeks good humoredly Go and bring that boy down to his dinner tell him it s all right and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather I won t bear it He won t come Sir He feels badly because you didn t believe him when he said he couldn t tell I think the shaking hurt his feelings very much Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed for Mr Laurence began to laugh and she knew the day was won I m sorry for that and ought to thank him for not shaking me I suppose What the dickens does the fellow expect and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness If I were you I d write him an apology Sir He says he won t come down till he has one and talks about Washington and goes on in an absurd way A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is and bring him down quite amiable Try it He likes fun and this way is better than talking I ll carry it up and teach him his duty Mr Laurence gave her a sharp look and put on his spectacles saying slowly You re a sly puss but I don t mind being managed by you and Beth Here give me a bit of paper and let us have done with this nonsense The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult Jo dropped a kiss on the top of Mr Laurence s bald head and ran up to slip the apology under Laurie s door advising him through the keyhole to be submissive decorous and a few other agreeable impossibilities Finding the door locked again she left the note to do its work and was going quietly away when the young gentleman slid down the banisters and waited for her at the bottom saying with his most virtuous expression of countenance What a good fellow you are Jo Did you get blown up he added laughing No he was pretty mild on the whole Ah I got it all round Even you cast me off over there and I felt just ready to go to the deuce he began apologetically Don t talk that way turn over a new leaf and begin again Teddy my son I keep turning over new leaves and spoiling them as I used to spoil my copybooks and I make so many beginnings there never will be an end he said dolefully Go and eat your dinner you ll feel better after it Men always croak when they are hungry and Jo whisked out at the front door after that That s a label on my sect answered Laurie quoting Amy as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over but the mischief was done for though others forgot it Meg remembered She never alluded to a certain person but she thought of him a good deal dreamed dreams more than ever and once Jo rummaging her sister s desk for stamps found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words Mrs John Brooke whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire feeling that Laurie s prank had hastened the evil day for her CHAPTER TWENTY TWO PLEASANT MEADOWS Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed The invalids improved rapidly and Mr March began to talk of returning early in the new year Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day amusing herself with the well beloved cats at first and in time with doll s sewing which had fallen sadly behind hand Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for the dear while Amy a loyal slave of the ring celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept As Christmas approached the usual mysteries began to haunt the house and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies in honor of this unusually merry Christmas Laurie was equally impracticable and would have had bonfires skyrockets and triumphal arches if he had had his own way After many skirmishes and snubbings the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid Christmas Day Hannah felt in her bones that it was going to be an unusually fine day and she proved herself a true prophetess for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success To begin with Mr March wrote that he should soon be with them then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning and being dressed in her mother s gift a soft crimson merino wrapper was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise Out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden crowned with holly bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand a great roll of music in the other a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH God bless you dear Queen Bess May nothing you dismay But health and peace and happiness Be yours this Christmas day Here s fruit to feed our busy bee And flowers for her nose Here s music for her pianee An afghan for her toes A portrait of Joanna see By Raphael No Who laboured with great industry To make it fair and true Accept a ribbon red I beg For Madam Purrer s tail And ice cream made by lovely Peg A Mont Blanc in a pail Their dearest love my makers laid Within my breast of snow Accept it and the Alpine maid From Laurie and from Jo How Beth laughed when she saw it how Laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them I m so full of happiness that if Father was only here I couldn t hold one drop more said Beth quite sighing with contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the Jungfrau had sent her So am I added Jo slapping the pocket wherein reposed the long desired Undine and Sintram I m sure I am echoed Amy poring over the engraved copy of the Madonna and Child which her mother had given her in a pretty frame Of course I am cried Meg smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress for Mr Laurence had insisted on giving it How can I be otherwise said Mrs March gratefully as her eyes went from her husband s letter to Beth s smiling face and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden chestnut and dark brown hair which the girls had just fastened on her breast Now and then in this workaday world things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion and what a comfort it is Half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more the drop came Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly He might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up though he only said in a queer breathless voice Here s another Christmas present for the March family Before the words were well out of his mouth he was whisked away somehow and in his place appeared a tall man muffled up to the eyes leaning on the arm of another tall man who tried to say something and couldn t Of course there was a general stampede and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits for the strangest things were done and no one said a word Mr March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet Mr Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake as he somewhat incoherently explained And Amy the dignified tumbled over a stool and never stopping to get up hugged and cried over her father s boots in the most touching manner Mrs March was the first to recover herself and held up her hand with a warning Hush Remember Beth But it was too late The study door flew open the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold joy put strength into the feeble limbs and Beth ran straight into her father s arms Never mind what happened just after that for the full hearts overflowed washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present It was not at all romantic but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again for Hannah was discovered behind the door sobbing over the fat turkey which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen As the laugh subsided Mrs March began to thank Mr Brooke for his faithful care of her husband at which Mr Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr March needed rest and seizing Laurie he precipitately retired Then the two invalids were ordered to repose which they did by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard Mr March told how he had longed to surprise them and how when the fine weather came he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it how devoted Brooke had been and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man Why Mr March paused a minute just there and after a glance at Meg who was violently poking the fire looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows I leave you to imagine Also why Mrs March gently nodded her head and asked rather abruptly if he wouldn t like to have something to eat Jo saw and understood the look and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea muttering to herself as she slammed the door I hate estimable young men with brown eyes There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day The fat turkey was a sight to behold when Hannah sent him up stuffed browned and decorated So was the plum pudding which melted in one s mouth likewise the jellies in which Amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot Everything turned out well which was a mercy Hannah said For my mind was that flustered Mum that it s a merrycle I didn t roast the pudding and stuff the turkey with raisins let alone bilin of it in a cloth Mr Laurence and his grandson dined with them also Mr Brooke at whom Jo glowered darkly to Laurie s infinite amusement Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table in which sat Beth and her father feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit They drank healths told stories sang songs reminisced as the old folks say and had a thoroughly good time A sleigh ride had been planned but the girls would not leave their father so the guests departed early and as twilight gathered the happy family sat together round the fire Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected to have Do you remember asked Jo breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things Rather a pleasant year on the whole said Meg smiling at the fire and congratulating herself on having treated Mr Brooke with dignity I think it s been a pretty hard one observed Amy watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes I m glad it s over because we ve got you back whispered Beth who sat on her father s knee Rather a rough road for you to travel my little pilgrims especially the latter part of it But you have got on bravely and I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon said Mr March looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him How do you know Did Mother tell you asked Jo Not much Straws show which way the wind blows and I ve made several discoveries today Oh tell us what they are cried Meg who sat beside him Here is one And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair he pointed to the roughened forefinger a burn on the back and two or three little hard spots on the palm I remember a time when this hand was white and smooth and your first care was to keep it so It was very pretty then but to me it is much prettier now for in this seeming blemishes I read a little history A burnt offering has been made to vanity this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters and I m sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time so much good will went into the stitches Meg my dear I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments I m proud to shake this good industrious little hand and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor she received it in the hearty pressure of her father s hand and the approving smile he gave her What about Jo Please say something nice for she has tried so hard and been so very very good to me said Beth in her father s ear He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite with an unusually mild expression in her face In spite of the curly crop I don t see the son Jo whom I left a year ago said Mr March I see a young lady who pins her collar straight laces her boots neatly and neither whistles talks slang nor lies on the rug as she used to do Her face is rather thin and pale just now with watching and anxiety but I like to look at it for it has grown gentler and her voice is lower She doesn t bounce but moves quietly and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me I rather miss my wild girl but if I get a strong helpful tenderhearted woman in her place I shall feel quite satisfied I don t know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep but I do know that in all Washington I couldn t find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five and twenty dollars my good girl sent me Jo s keen eyes were rather dim for a minute and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father s praise feeling that she did deserve a portion of it Now Beth said Amy longing for her turn but ready to wait There s so little of her I m afraid to say much for fear she will slip away altogether though she is not so shy as she used to be began their father cheerfully But recollecting how nearly he had lost her he held her close saying tenderly with her cheek against his own I ve got you safe my Beth and I ll keep you so please God After a minute s silence he looked down at Amy who sat on the cricket at his feet and said with a caress of the shining hair I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner ran errands for her mother all the afternoon gave Meg her place tonight and has waited on every one with patience and good humor I also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears so I conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures I am glad of this for though I should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others What are you thinking of Beth asked Jo when Amy had thanked her father and told about her ring I read in Pilgrim s Progress today how after many troubles Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round and there they rested happily as we do now before they went on to their journey s end answered Beth adding as she slipped out of her father s arms and went to the instrument It s singing time now and I want to be in my old place I ll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard I made the music for Father because he likes the verses So sitting at the dear little piano Beth softly touched the keys and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn which was a singularly fitting song for her He that is down need fear no fall He that is low no pride He that is humble ever shall Have God to be his guide I am content with what I have Little be it or much And Lord Contentment still I crave Because Thou savest such Fulness to them a burden is That go on pilgrimage Here little and hereafter bliss Is best from age to age CHAPTER TWENTY THREE AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION Like bees swarming after their queen mother and daughters hovered about Mr March the next day neglecting everything to look at wait upon and listen to the new invalid who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth s sofa with the other three close by and Hannah popping in her head now and then to peek at the dear man nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness But something was needed and the elder ones felt it though none confessed the fact Mr and Mrs March looked at one another with an anxious expression as their eyes followed Meg Jo had sudden fits of sobriety and was seen to shake her fist at Mr Brooke s umbrella which had been left in the hall Meg was absent minded shy and silent started when the bell rang and colored when John s name was mentioned Amy said Everyone seemed waiting for something and couldn t settle down which was queer since Father was safe at home and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn t run over as usual Laurie went by in the afternoon and seeing Meg at the window seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit for he fell down on one knee in the snow beat his breast tore his hair and clasped his hands imploringly as if begging some boon And when Meg told him to behave himself and go away he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair What does the goose mean said Meg laughing and trying to look unconscious He s showing you how your John will go on by and by Touching isn t it answered Jo scornfully Don t say my John it isn t proper or true but Meg s voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her Please don t plague me Jo I ve told you I don t care much about him and there isn t to be anything said but we are all to be friendly and go on as before We can t for something has been said and Laurie s mischief has spoiled you for me I see it and so does Mother You are not like your old self a bit and seem ever so far away from me I don t mean to plague you and will bear it like a man but I do wish it was all settled I hate to wait so if you mean ever to do it make haste and have it over quickly said Jo pettishly I can t say anything till he speaks and he won t because Father said I was too young began Meg bending over her work with a queer little smile which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point If he did speak you wouldn t know what to say but would cry or blush or let him have his own way instead of giving a good decided no I m not so silly and weak as you think I know just what I should say for I ve planned it all so I needn t be taken unawares There s no knowing what may happen and I wished to be prepared Jo couldn t help smiling at the important air which Meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks Would you mind telling me what you d say asked Jo more respectfully Not at all You are sixteen now quite old enough to be my confidant and my experience will be useful to you by and by perhaps in your own affairs of this sort Don t mean to have any It s fun to watch other people philander but I should feel like a fool doing it myself said Jo looking alarmed at the thought I think not if you liked anyone very much and he liked you Meg spoke as if to herself and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man said Jo rudely shortening her sister s little reverie Oh I should merely say quite calmly and decidedly Thank you Mr Brooke you are very kind but I agree with Father that I am too young to enter into any engagement at present so please say no more but let us be friends as we were Hum that s stiff and cool enough I don t believe you ll ever say it and I know he won t be satisfied if you do If he goes on like the rejected lovers in books you ll give in rather than hurt his feelings No I won t I shall tell him I ve made up my mind and shall walk out of the room with dignity Meg rose as she spoke and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change and when someone gave a modest tap opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable Good afternoon I came to get my umbrella that is to see how your father finds himself today said Mr Brooke getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other It s very well he s in the rack I ll get him and tell it you are here And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity But the instant she vanished Meg began to sidle toward the door murmuring Mother will like to see you Pray sit down I ll call her Don t go Are you afraid of me Margaret and Mr Brooke looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead for he had never called her Margaret before and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it Anxious to appear friendly and at her ease she put out her hand with a confiding gesture and said gratefully How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father I only wish I could thank you for it Shall I tell you how asked Mr Brooke holding the small hand fast in both his own and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen Oh no please don t I d rather not she said trying to withdraw her hand and looking frightened in spite of her denial I won t trouble you I only want to know if you care for me a little Meg I love you so much dear added Mr Brooke tenderly This was the moment for the calm proper speech but Meg didn t make it She forgot every word of it hung her head and answered I don t know so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply He seemed to think it was worth the trouble for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied pressed the plump hand gratefully and said in his most persuasive tone Will you try and find out I want to know so much for I can t go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not I m too young faltered Meg wondering why she was so fluttered yet rather enjoying it I ll wait and in the meantime you could be learning to like me Would it be a very hard lesson dear Not if I chose to learn it but Please choose to learn Meg I love to teach and this is easier than German broke in John getting possession of the other hand so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it His tone was properly beseeching but stealing a shy look at him Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success This nettled her Annie Moffat s foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind and the love of power which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her She felt excited and strange and not knowing what else to do followed a capricious impulse and withdrawing her hands said petulantly I don t choose Please go away and let me be Poor Mr Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before and it rather bewildered him Do you really mean that he asked anxiously following her as she walked away Yes I do I don t want to be worried about such things Father says I needn t it s too soon and I d rather not Mayn t I hope you ll change your mind by and by I ll wait and say nothing till you have had more time Don t play with me Meg I didn t think that of you Don t think of me at all I d rather you wouldn t said Meg taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover s patience and her own power He was grave and pale now and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did He just stood looking at her so wistfully so tenderly that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself What would have happened next I cannot say if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute The old lady couldn t resist her longing to see her nephew for she had met Laurie as she took her airing and hearing of Mr March s arrival drove straight out to see him The family were all busy in the back part of the house and she had made her way quietly in hoping to surprise them She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a ghost and Mr Brooke vanished into the study Bless me what s all this cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady It s Father s frie
