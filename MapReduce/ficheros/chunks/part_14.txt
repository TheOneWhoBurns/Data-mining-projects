a month you d see things that would astonish you a trifle Upon my word when I see one of those harum scarum girls I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin Out upon you fie upon you Bold faced jig It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between Laurie s chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples Jo knew that young Laurence was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas was much smiled upon by their daughters and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him so she watched him rather jealously fearing he would be spoiled and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone she said dropping her voice If you must have a vent Teddy go and devote yourself to one of the pretty modest girls whom you do respect and not waste your time with the silly ones You really advise it and Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face Yes I do but you d better wait till you are through college on the whole and be fitting yourself for the place meantime You re not half good enough for well whoever the modest girl may be and Jo looked a little queer likewise for a name had almost escaped her That I m not acquiesced Laurie with an expression of humility quite new to him as he dropped his eyes and absently wound Jo s apron tassel round his finger Mercy on us this will never do thought Jo adding aloud Go and sing to me I m dying for some music and always like yours I d rather stay here thank you Well you can t there isn t room Go and make yourself useful since you are too big to be ornamental I thought you hated to be tied to a woman s apron string retorted Jo quoting certain rebellious words of his own Ah that depends on who wears the apron and Laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel Are you going demanded Jo diving for the pillow He fled at once and the minute it was well Up with the bonnets of bonnie Dundee she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon Jo lay long awake that night and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth s bedside with the anxious inquiry What is it dear I thought you were asleep sobbed Beth Is it the old pain my precious No it s a new one but I can bear it and Beth tried to check her tears Tell me all about it and let me cure it as I often did the other You can t there is no cure There Beth s voice gave way and clinging to her sister she cried so despairingly that Jo was frightened Where is it Shall I call Mother No no don t call her don t tell her I shall be better soon Lie down here and poor my head I ll be quiet and go to sleep indeed I will Jo obeyed but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth s hot forehead and wet eyelids her heart was very full and she longed to speak But young as she was Jo had learned that hearts like flowers cannot be rudely handled but must open naturally so though she believed she knew the cause of Beth s new pain she only said in her tenderest tone Does anything trouble you deary Yes Jo after a long pause Wouldn t it comfort you to tell me what it is Not now not yet Then I won t ask but remember Bethy that Mother and Jo are always glad to hear and help you if they can I know it I ll tell you by and by Is the pain better now Oh yes much better you are so comfortable Jo Go to sleep dear I ll stay with you So cheek to cheek they fell asleep and on the morrow Beth seemed quite herself again for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long and a loving word can medicine most ills But Jo had made up her mind and after pondering over a project for some days she confided it to her mother You asked me the other day what my wishes were I ll tell you one of them Marmee she began as they sat along together I want to go away somewhere this winter for a change Why Jo and her mother looked up quickly as if the words suggested a double meaning With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly I want something new I feel restless and anxious to be seeing doing and learning more than I am I brood too much over my own small affairs and need stirring up so as I can be spared this winter I d like to hop a little way and try my wings Where will you hop To New York I had a bright idea yesterday and this is it You know Mrs Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew It s rather hard to find just the thing but I think I should suit if I tried My dear go out to service in that great boarding house and Mrs March looked surprised but not displeased It s not exactly going out to service for Mrs Kirke is your friend the kindest soul that ever lived and would make things pleasant for me I know Her family is separate from the rest and no one knows me there Don t care if they do It s honest work and I m not ashamed of it Nor I But your writing All the better for the change I shall see and hear new things get new ideas and even if I haven t much time there I shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish I have no doubt of it but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy No Mother May I know the others Jo looked up and Jo looked down then said slowly with sudden color in her cheeks It may be vain and wrong to say it but I m afraid Laurie is getting too fond of me Then you don t care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you and Mrs March looked anxious as she put the question Mercy no I love the dear boy as I always have and am immensely proud of him but as for anything more it s out of the question I m glad of that Jo Why please Because dear I don t think you suited to one another As friends you are very happy and your frequent quarrels soon blow over but I fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life You are too much alike and too fond of freedom not to mention hot tempers and strong wills to get on happily together in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance as well as love That s just the feeling I had though I couldn t express it I m glad you think he is only beginning to care for me It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy for I couldn t fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude could I You are sure of his feeling for you The color deepened in Jo s cheeks as she answered with the look of mingled pleasure pride and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers I m afraid it is so Mother He hasn t said anything but he looks a great deal I think I had better go away before it comes to anything I agree with you and if it can be managed you shall go Jo looked relieved and after a pause said smiling How Mrs Moffat would wonder at your want of management if she knew and how she will rejoice that Annie may still hope Ah Jo mothers may differ in their management but the hope is the same in all the desire to see their children happy Meg is so and I am content with her success You I leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it for only then will you find that there is something sweeter Amy is my chief care now but her good sense will help her For Beth I indulge no hopes except that she may be well By the way she seems brighter this last day or two Have you spoken to her Yes she owned she had a trouble and promised to tell me by and by I said no more for I think I know it and Jo told her little story Mrs March shook her head and did not take so romantic a view of the case but looked grave and repeated her opinion that for Laurie s sake Jo should go away for a time Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled then I ll run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic Beth must think I m going to please myself as I am for I can t talk about Laurie to her But she can pet and comfort him after I m gone and so cure him of this romantic notion He s been through so many little trials of the sort he s used to it and will soon get over his lovelornity Jo spoke hopefully but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this little trial would be harder than the others and that Laurie would not get over his lovelornity as easily as heretofore The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon for Mrs Kirke gladly accepted Jo and promised to make a pleasant home for her The teaching would render her independent and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable Jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit When all was settled with fear and trembling she told Laurie but to her surprise he took it very quietly He had been graver than usual of late but very pleasant and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf he answered soberly So I am and I mean this one shall stay turned Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then and made her preparations with a lightened heart for Beth seemed more cheerful and hoped she was doing the best for all One thing I leave in your especial care she said the night before she left You mean your papers asked Beth No my boy Be very good to him won t you Of course I will but I can t fill your place and he ll miss you sadly It won t hurt him so remember I leave him in your charge to plague pet and keep in order I ll do my best for your sake promised Beth wondering why Jo looked at her so queerly When Laurie said good by he whispered significantly It won t do a bit of good Jo My eye is on you so mind what you do or I ll come and bring you home CHAPTER THIRTY THREE JO S JOURNAL New York November Dear Marmee and Beth I m going to write you a regular volume for I ve got heaps to tell though I m not a fine young lady traveling on the continent When I lost sight of Father s dear old face I felt a trifle blue and might have shed a briny drop or two if an Irish lady with four small children all crying more or less hadn t diverted my mind for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar Soon the sun came out and taking it as a good omen I cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart Mrs Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once even in that big house full of strangers She gave me a funny little sky parlor all she had but there is a stove in it and a nice table in a sunny window so I can sit here and write whenever I like A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs and I took a fancy to my den on the spot The nursery where I am to teach and sew is a pleasant room next Mrs Kirke s private parlor and the two little girls are pretty children rather spoiled I fancy but they took to me after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs and I ve no doubt I shall make a model governess I am to have my meals with the children if I prefer it to the great table and for the present I do for I am bashful though no one will believe it Now my dear make yourself at home said Mrs K in her motherly way I m on the drive from morning to night as you may suppose with such a family but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the children are safe with you My rooms are always open to you and your own shall be as comfortable as I can make it There are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable and your evenings are always free Come to me if anything goes wrong and be as happy as you can There s the tea bell I must run and change my cap And off she bustled leaving me to settle myself in my new nest As I went downstairs soon after I saw something I liked The flights are very long in this tall house and as I stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up I saw a gentleman come along behind her take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand carry it all the way up put it down at a door near by and walk away saying with a kind nod and a foreign accent It goes better so The little back is too young to haf such heaviness Wasn t it good of him I like such things for as Father says trifles show character When I mentioned it to Mrs K that evening she laughed and said That must have been Professor Bhaer he s always doing things of that sort Mrs K told me he was from Berlin very learned and good but poor as a church mouse and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here according to the wishes of his sister who married an American Not a very romantic story but it interested me and I was glad to hear that Mrs K lends him her parlor for some of his scholars There is a glass door between it and the nursery and I mean to peep at him and then I ll tell you how he looks He s almost forty so it s no harm Marmee After tea and a go to bed romp with the little girls I attacked the big workbasket and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend I shall keep a journal letter and send it once a week so goodnight and more tomorrow Tuesday Eve Had a lively time in my seminary this morning for the children acted like Sancho and at one time I really thought I should shake them all round Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still After luncheon the girl took them out for a walk and I went to my needlework like little Mabel with a willing mind I was thanking my stars that I d learned to make nice buttonholes when the parlor door opened and shut and someone began to hum Kennst Du Das Land like a big bumblebee It was dreadfully improper I know but I couldn t resist the temptation and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door I peeped in Professor Bhaer was there and while he arranged his books I took a good look at him A regular German rather stout with brown hair tumbled all over his head a bushy beard good nose the kindest eyes I ever saw and a splendid big voice that does one s ears good after our sharp or slipshod American gabble His clothes were rusty his hands were large and he hadn t a really handsome feature in his face except his beautiful teeth yet I liked him for he had a fine head his linen was very nice and he looked like a gentleman though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe He looked sober in spite of his humming till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun and stroke the cat who received him like an old friend Then he smiled and when a tap came at the door called out in a loud brisk tone Herein I was just going to run when I caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book and stopped to see what was going on Me wants me Bhaer said the mite slamming down her book and running to meet him Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer Come then and take a goot hug from him my Tina said the Professor catching her up with a laugh and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him Now me mus tuddy my lessin went on the funny little thing So he put her up at the table opened the great dictionary she had brought and gave her a paper and pencil and she scribbled away turning a leaf now and then and passing her little fat finger down the page as if finding a word so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh while Mr Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own though she looked more French than German Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work and there I virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door One of the girls kept laughing affectedly and saying Now Professor in a coquettish tone and the other pronounced her German with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober Both seemed to try his patience sorely for more than once I heard him say emphatically No no it is not so you haf not attend to what I say and once there was a loud rap as if he struck the table with his book followed by the despairing exclamation Prut It all goes bad this day Poor man I pitied him and when the girls were gone took just one more peep to see if he survived it He seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair tired out and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two when he jumped up put his books in his pocket as if ready for another lesson and taking little Tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms he carried her quietly away I fancy he has a hard life of it Mrs Kirke asked me if I wouldn t go down to the five o clock dinner and feeling a little bit homesick I thought I would just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me So I made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs Kirke but as she is short and I m tall my efforts at concealment were rather a failure She gave me a seat by her and after my face cooled off I plucked up courage and looked about me The long table was full and every one intent on getting their dinner the gentlemen especially who seemed to be eating on time for they bolted in every sense of the word vanishing as soon as they were done There was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves young couples absorbed in each other married ladies in their babies and old gentlemen in politics I don t think I shall care to have much to do with any of them except one sweetfaced maiden lady who looks as if she had something in her Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive deaf old gentleman on one side and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other If Amy had been here she d have turned her back on him forever because sad to relate he had a great appetite and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified her ladyship I didn t mind for I like to see folks eat with a relish as Hannah says and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day As I went upstairs after dinner two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror and I heard one say low to the other Who s the new party Governess or something of that sort What the deuce is she at our table for Friend of the old lady s Handsome head but no style Not a bit of it Give us a light and come on I felt angry at first and then I didn t care for a governess is as good as a clerk and I ve got sense if I haven t style which is more than some people have judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away smoking like bad chimneys I hate ordinary people Thursday Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching sewing and writing in my little room which is very cozy with a light and fire I picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here The little thing has lost her heart to Mr Bhaer and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home which delights him as he is very fond of children though a bacheldore Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents the presents he brings and the splendid tales he tells The younger men quiz him it seems call him Old Fritz Lager Beer Ursa Major and make all manner of jokes on his name But he enjoys it like a boy Mrs Kirke says and takes it so good naturedly that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways The maiden lady is a Miss Norton rich cultivated and kind She spoke to me at dinner today for I went to table again it s such fun to watch people and asked me to come and see her at her room She has fine books and pictures knows interesting persons and seems friendly so I shall make myself agreeable for I do want to get into good society only it isn t the same sort that Amy likes I was in our parlor last evening when Mr Bhaer came in with some newspapers for Mrs Kirke She wasn t there but Minnie who is a little old woman introduced me very prettily This is Mamma s friend Miss March Yes and she s jolly and we like her lots added Kitty who is an enfant terrible We both bowed and then we laughed for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast Ah yes I hear these naughty ones go to vex you Mees Marsch If so again call at me and I come he said with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches I promised I would and he departed but it seems as if I was doomed to see a good deal of him for today as I passed his door on my way out by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella It flew open and there he stood in his dressing gown with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other He didn t seem at all ashamed of it for when I explained and hurried on he waved his hand sock and all saying in his loud cheerful way You haf a fine day to make your walk Bon voyage Mademoiselle I laughed all the way downstairs but it was a little pathetic also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes The German gentlemen embroider I know but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty Saturday Nothing has happened to write about except a call on Miss Norton who has a room full of pretty things and who was very charming for she showed me all her treasures and asked me if I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts as her escort if I enjoyed them She put it as a favor but I m sure Mrs Kirke has told her about us and she does it out of kindness to me I m as proud as Lucifer but such favors from such people don t burden me and I accepted gratefully When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that I looked in and there was Mr Bhaer down on his hands and knees with Tina on his back Kitty leading him with a jump rope and Minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs We are playing nargerie explained Kitty Dis is mine effalunt added Tina holding on by the Professor s hair Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon when Franz and Emil come doesn t she Mr Bhaer said Minnie The effalunt sat up looking as much in earnest as any of them and said soberly to me I gif you my wort it is so if we make too large a noise you shall say Hush to us and we go more softly I promised to do so but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did for a more glorious frolic I never witnessed They played tag and soldiers danced and sang and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the Professor while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops and the little koblods who ride the snowflakes as they fall I wish Americans were as simple and natural as Germans don t you I m so fond of writing I should go spinning on forever if motives of economy didn t stop me for though I ve used thin paper and written fine I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need Pray forward Amy s as soon as you can spare them My small news will sound very flat after her splendors but you will like them I know Is Teddy studying so hard that he can t find time to write to his friends Take good care of him for me Beth and tell me all about the babies and give heaps of love to everyone From your faithful Jo P S On reading over my letter it strikes me as rather Bhaery but I am always interested in odd people and I really had nothing else to write about Bless you DECEMBER My Precious Betsey As this is to be a scribble scrabble letter I direct it to you for it may amuse you and give you some idea of my goings on for though quiet they are rather amusing for which oh be joyful After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts in the way of mental and moral agriculture my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the boys but I do my duty by them and they are fond of me Franz and Emil are jolly little lads quite after my own heart for the mixture of German and American spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence Saturday afternoons are riotous times whether spent in the house or out for on pleasant days they all go to walk like a seminary with the Professor and myself to keep order and then such fun We are very good friends now and I ve begun to take lessons I really couldn t help it and it all came about in such a droll way that I must tell you To begin at the beginning Mrs Kirke called to me one day as I passed Mr Bhaer s room where she was rummaging Did you ever see such a den my dear Just come and help me put these books to rights for I ve turned everything upside down trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago I went in and while we worked I looked about me for it was a den to be sure Books and papers everywhere a broken meerschaum and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat and a box of white mice adorned the other Half finished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts Dirty little boots stood drying before the fire and traces of the dearly beloved boys for whom he makes a slave of himself were to be seen all over the room After a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found one over the bird cage one covered with ink and a third burned brown having been used as a holder Such a man laughed good natured Mrs K as she put the relics in the rag bag I suppose the others are torn up to rig ships bandage cut fingers or make kite tails It s dreadful but I can t scold him He s so absent minded and goodnatured he lets those boys ride over him roughshod I agreed to do his washing and mending but he forgets to give out his things and I forget to look them over so he comes to a sad pass sometimes Let me mend them said I I don t mind it and he needn t know I d like to he s so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books So I have got his things in order and knit heels into two pairs of the socks for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns Nothing was said and I hoped he wouldn t find it out but one day last week he caught me at it Hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn for Tina runs in and out leaving the door open and I can hear I had been sitting near this door finishing off the last sock and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar who is as stupid as I am The girl had gone and I thought he had also it was so still and I was busily gabbling over a verb and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way when a little crow made me look up and there was Mr Bhaer looking and laughing quietly while he made signs to Tina not to betray him So he said as I stopped and stared like a goose you peep at me I peep at you and this is not bad but see I am not pleasanting when I say haf you a wish for German Yes but you are too busy I am too stupid to learn I blundered out as red as a peony Prut We will make the time and we fail not to find the sense At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness for look you Mees Marsch I haf this debt to pay And he pointed to my work Yes they say to one another these so kind ladies he is a stupid old fellow he will see not what we do he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall and believe that strings make theirselves Ah But I haf an eye and I see much I haf a heart and I feel thanks for this Come a little lesson then and now or no more good fairy works for me and mine Of course I couldn t say anything after that and as it really is a splendid opportunity I made the bargain and we began I took four lessons and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog The Professor was very patient with me but it must have been torment to him and now and then he d look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a toss up with me whether to laugh or cry I tried both ways and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever but didn t blame him a particle and was scrambling my papers together meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard when in he came as brisk and beaming as if I d covered myself in glory Now we shall try a new way You and I will read these pleasant little marchen together and dig no more in that dry book that goes in the corner for making us trouble He spoke so kindly and opened Hans Anderson s fairy tales so invitingly before me that I was more ashamed than ever and went at my lesson in a neck or nothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely I forgot my bashfulness and pegged away no other word will express it with all my might tumbling over long words pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute and doing my very best When I finished reading my first page and stopped for breath he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way Das ist gut Now we go well My turn I do him in German gif me your ear And away he went rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear Fortunately the story was The Constant Tin Soldier which is droll you know so I could laugh and I did though I didn t understand half he read for I couldn t help it he was so earnest I so excited and the whole thing so comical After that we got on better and now I read my lessons pretty well for this way of studying suits me and I can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly I like it very much and he doesn t seem tired of it yet which is very good of him isn t it I mean to give him something on Christmas for I dare not offer money Tell me something nice Marmee I m glad Laurie seems so happy and busy that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow You see Beth manages him better than I did I m not jealous dear do your best only don t make a saint of him I m afraid I couldn t like him without a spice of human naughtiness Read him bits of my letters I haven t time to write much and that will do just as well Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable JANUARY A Happy New Year to you all my dearest family which of course includes Mr L and a young man by the name of Teddy I can t tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle for I didn t get it till night and had given up hoping Your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so I was disappointed for I d had a kind of feeling that you wouldn t forget me I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy battered looking bundle was brought to me I just hugged it and pranced It was so homey and refreshing that I sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way The things were just what I wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought Beth s new ink bib was capital and Hannah s box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure I ll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent Marmee and read carefully the books Father has marked Thank you all heaps and heaps Speaking of books reminds me that I m getting rich in that line for on New Year s Day Mr Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare It is one he values much and I ve often admired it set up in the place of honor with his German Bible Plato Homer and Milton so you may imagine how I felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my own name in it from my friend Friedrich Bhaer You say often you wish a library Here I gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one Read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen I thanked him as well as I could and talk now about my library as if I had a hundred books I never knew how much there was in Shakespeare before but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me Now don t laugh at his horrid name It isn t pronounced either Bear or Beer as people will say it but something between the two as only Germans can give it I m glad you both like what I tell you about him and hope you will know him some day Mother would admire his warm heart Father his wise head I admire both and feel rich in my new friend Friedrich Bhaer Not having much money or knowing what he d like I got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly They were useful pretty or funny a new standish on his table a little vase for his flower he always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he says and a holder for his blower so that he needn t burn up what Amy calls mouchoirs I made it like those Beth invented a big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes It took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue so it was rather a failure after all Poor as he is he didn t forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the French laundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him I was so glad of that They got up a masquerade and had a gay time New Year s Eve I didn t mean to go down having no dress But at the last minute Mrs Kirke remembered some old brocades and Miss Norton lent me lace and feathers So I dressed up as Mrs Malaprop and sailed in with a mask on No one knew me for I disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty Miss March for they think I am very stiff and cool most of them and so I am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the Nile I enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me I heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I d been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters Meg will relish that joke Mr Bhaer was Nick Bottom and Tina was Titania a perfect little fairy in his arms To see them dance was quite a landscape to use a Teddyism I had a very happy New Year after all and when I thought it over in my room I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for I m cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than I used to which is satisfactory Bless you all Ever your loving Jo CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR FRIEND Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort Jo still found time for literary labors The purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl but the means she took to gain her end were not the best She saw that money conferred power money and power therefore she resolved to have not to be used for herself alone but for those whom she loved more than life The dream of filling home with comforts giving Beth everything she wanted from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom going abroad herself and always having more than enough so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity had been for years Jo s most cherished castle in the air The prize story experience had seemed to open a way which might after long traveling and much uphill work lead to this delightful chateau en Espagne But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time for public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter hearted Jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers Like that immortal hero she reposed awhile after the first attempt which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the giant s treasures if I remember rightly But the up again and take another spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags She took to writing sensation stories for in those dark ages even all perfect America read rubbish She told no one but concocted a thrilling tale and boldly carried it herself to Mr Dashwood editor of the Weekly Volcano She had never read Sartor Resartus but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners So she dressed herself in her best and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room a cloud of cigar smoke and the presence of three gentlemen sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance Somewhat daunted by this reception Jo hesitated on the threshold murmuring in much embarrassment Excuse me I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office I wished to see Mr Dashwood Down went the highest pair of heels up rose the smokiest gentleman and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep Feeling that she must get through the matter somehow Jo produced her manuscript and blushing redder and redder with each sentence blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion A friend of mine desired me to offer a story just as an experiment would like your opinion be glad to write more if this suits While she blushed and blundered Mr Dashwood had taken the manuscript and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages Not a first attempt I take it observing that the pages were numbered covered only on one side and not tied up with a ribbon sure sign of a novice No sir She has had some experience and got a prize for a tale in the Blarneystone Banner Oh did she and Mr Dashwood gave Jo a quick look which seemed to take note of everything she had on from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots Well you can leave it if you like We ve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present but I ll run my eye over it and give you an answer next week Now Jo did not like to leave it for Mr Dashwood didn t suit her at all but under the circumstances there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away looking particularly tall and dignified as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed Just then she was both for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of my friend was considered a good joke and a laugh produced by some inaudible remark of the editor as he closed the door completed her discomfiture Half resolving never to return she went home and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week When she went again Mr Dashwood was alone whereat she rejoiced Mr Dashwood was much wider awake than before which was agreeable and Mr Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first We ll take this editors never say I if you don t object to a few alterations It s too long but omitting the passages I ve marked will make it just the right length he said in a businesslike tone Jo hardly knew her own MS again so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs but feeling as a tender parent might on being asked to cut off her baby s legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral reflections which she had carefully put in as ballast for much romance had been stricken out But Sir I thought every story should have some sort of a moral so I took care to have a few of my sinners repent Mr Dashwoods s editorial gravity relaxed into a smile for Jo had forgotten her friend and spoken as only an author could People want to be amused not preached at you know Morals don t sell nowadays Which was not quite a correct statement by the way You think it would do with these alterations then Yes it s a new plot and pretty well worked up language good and so on was Mr Dashwood s affable reply What do you that is what compensation began Jo not exactly knowing how to express herself Oh yes well we give from twenty five to thirty for things of this sort Pay when it comes out returned Mr Dashwood as if that point had escaped him Such trifles do escape the editorial mind it is said Very well you can have it said Jo handing back the story with a satisfied air for after the dollar a column work even twenty five seemed good pay Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this asked Jo unconscious of her little slip of the tongue and emboldened by her success Well we ll look at it Can t promise to take it Tell her to make it short and spicy and never mind the moral What name would your friend like to put on it in a careless tone None at all if you please she doesn t wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume said Jo blushing in spite of herself Just as she likes of course The tale will be out next week Will you call for the money or shall I send it asked Mr Dashwood who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be I ll call Good morning Sir As she departed Mr Dashwood put up his feet with the graceful remark Poor and proud as usual but she ll do Following Mr Dashwood s directions and making Mrs Northbury her model Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend she came up again not much the worse for her ducking Like most young scribblers she went abroad for her characters and scenery and banditti counts gypsies nuns and duchesses appeared upon her stage and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected Her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar punctuation and probability and Mr Dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks on being offered higher wages had basely left him in the lurch She soon became interested in her work for her emaciated purse grew stout and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed One thing disturbed her satisfaction and that was that she did not tell them at home She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not approve and preferred to have her own way first and beg pardon afterward It was easy to keep her secret for no name appeared with her stories Mr Dashwood had of course found it out very soon but promised to be dumb and for a wonder kept his word She thought it would do her no harm for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her well kept secret But Mr Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers history and romance land and sea science and art police records and lunatic asylums had to be ransacked for the purpose Jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society so regarding it in a business light she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy Eager to find material for stories and bent on making them original in plot if not masterly in execution she searched newspapers for accidents incidents and crimes She excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons She studied faces in the street and characters good bad and indifferent all about her She delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new and introduced herself to folly sin and misery as well as her limited opportunities allowed She thought she was prospering finely but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman s character She was living in bad society and imaginary though it was its influence affected her for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life which comes soon enough to all of us She was beginning to feel rather than see this for much describing of other people s passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own a morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge Wrongdoing always brings its own punishment and when Jo most needed hers she got it I don t know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read character or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest brave and strong but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun Jo was discovering a live hero who interested her in spite of many human imperfections Mr Bhaer in one of their conversations had advised her to study simple true and lovely characters wherever she found them as good training for a writer Jo took him at his word for she coolly turned round and studied him a proceeding which would have much surprised him had he known it for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo at first He was neither rich nor great young nor handsome in no respect what is called fascinating imposing or brilliant and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth He was poor yet always appeared to be giving something away a stranger yet everyone was his friend no longer young but as happy hearted as a boy plain and peculiar yet his face looked beautiful to many and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake Jo often watched him trying to discover the charm and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle If he had any sorrow it sat with its head under its wing and he turned only his sunny side to the world There were lines upon his forehead but Time seemed to have touched him gently remembering how kind he was to others The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs his eyes were never cold or hard and his big hand had a warm strong grasp that was more expressive than words His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer They looked as if they were at ease and liked to make him comfortable His capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath His rusty coat had a social air and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full His very boots were benevolent and his collars never stiff and raspy like other people s That s it said Jo to herself when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward one s fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout German teacher who shoveled in his dinner darned his own socks and was burdened with the name of Bhaer Jo valued goodness highly but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect and a little discovery which she made about the Professor added much to her regard for him He never spoke of himself and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity till a countryman came to see him He never spoke of himself and in a conversation with Miss Norton divulged the pleasing fact From her Jo learned it and liked it all the better because Mr Bhaer had never told it She felt proud to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin though only a poor language master in America and his homely hard working life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner Miss Norton had the entree into most society which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her The solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor She took them with her one night to a select symposium held in honor of several celebrities Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off But her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all Imagine her dismay on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on spirit fire and dew to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance Turning
