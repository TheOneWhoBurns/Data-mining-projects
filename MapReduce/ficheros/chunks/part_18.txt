e certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring lost much of her relish for society and went out sketching alone a good deal She never had much to show when she came home but was studying nature I dare say while she sat for hours with her hands folded on the terrace at Valrosa or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her a stalwart knight carved on a tomb a young man asleep in the grass with his hat over his eyes or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art which was safe but not altogether satisfactory Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred and finding denials useless and explanations impossible Amy left her to think what she liked taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to Egypt That was all but he understood it and looked relieved as he said to himself with a venerable air I was sure she would think better of it Poor old fellow I ve been through it all and I can sympathize With that he heaved a great sigh and then as if he had discharged his duty to the past put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy s letter luxuriously While these changes were going on abroad trouble had come at home But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy and when the next found her the grass was green above her sister The sad news met her at Vevay for the heat had driven them from Nice in May and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland by way of Genoa and the Italian lakes She bore it very well and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit for since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth she had better stay and let absence soften her sorrow But her heart was very heavy she longed to be at home and every day looked wistfully across the lake waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her He did come very soon for the same mail brought letters to them both but he was in Germany and it took some days to reach him The moment he read it he packed his knapsack bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians and was off to keep his promise with a heart full of joy and sorrow hope and suspense He knew Vevay well and as soon as the boat touched the little quay he hurried along the shore to La Tour where the Carrols were living en pension The garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake but no the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting down a flash of time should present her But monsieur could not wait even a flash of time and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake with chestnuts rustling overhead ivy climbing everywhere and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water At one corner of the wide low wall was a seat and here Amy often came to read or work or console herself with the beauty all about her She was sitting here that day leaning her head on her hand with a homesick heart and heavy eyes thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come She did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden He stood a minute looking at her with new eyes seeing what no one had ever seen before the tender side of Amy s character Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow the blotted letters in her lap the black ribbon that tied up her hair the womanly pain and patience in her face even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie for he had given it to her and she wore it as her only ornament If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him for dropping everything she ran to him exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing Oh Laurie Laurie I knew you d come to me I think everything was said and settled then for as they stood together quite silent for a moment with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one Amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as Laurie and Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who could fill Jo s place and make him happy He did not tell her so but she was not disappointed for both felt the truth were satisfied and gladly left the rest to silence In a minute Amy went back to her place and while she dried her tears Laurie gathered up the scattered papers finding in the sight of sundry well worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future As he sat down beside her Amy felt shy again and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting I couldn t help it I felt so lonely and sad and was so very glad to see you It was such a surprise to look up and find you just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn t come she said trying in vain to speak quite naturally I came the minute I heard I wish I could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth but I can only feel and He could not get any further for he too turned bashful all of a sudden and did not quite know what to say He longed to lay Amy s head down on his shoulder and tell her to have a good cry but he did not dare so took her hand instead and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words You needn t say anything this comforts me she said softly Beth is well and happy and I mustn t wish her back but I dread the going home much as I long to see them all We won t talk about it now for it makes me cry and I want to enjoy you while you stay You needn t go right back need you Not if you want me dear I do so much Aunt and Flo are very kind but you seem like one of the family and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once and gave her just what she wanted the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed Poor little soul you look as if you d grieved yourself half sick I m going to take care of you so don t cry any more but come and walk about with me the wind is too chilly for you to sit still he said in the half caressing half commanding way that Amy liked as he tied on her hat drew her arm through his and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the new leaved chestnuts He felt more at ease upon his legs and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon a familiar face to smile at her and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers and seemed expressly made for them so sunny and secluded was it with nothing but the tower to overlook them and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words as it rippled by below For an hour this new pair walked and talked or rested on the wall enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place and when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden The moment Mrs Carrol saw the girl s altered face she was illuminated with a new idea and exclaimed to herself Now I understand it all the child has been pining for young Laurence Bless my heart I never thought of such a thing With praiseworthy discretion the good lady said nothing and betrayed no sign of enlightenment but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged Amy to enjoy his society for it would do her more good than so much solitude Amy was a model of docility and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with Flo she was left to entertain her friend and did it with more than her usual success At Nice Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded At Vevay Laurie was never idle but always walking riding boating or studying in the most energetic manner while Amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could He said the change was owing to the climate and she did not contradict him being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits The invigorating air did them both good and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies They seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills The fresh winds blew away desponding doubts delusive fancies and moody mists The warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas tender hopes and happy thoughts The lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying Little children love one another In spite of the new sorrow it was a very happy time so happy that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word It took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first and as he had firmly believed his last and only love He consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo s sister was almost the same as Jo s self and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well His first wooing had been of the tempestuous order and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret He was not ashamed of it but put it away as one of the bitter sweet experiences of his life for which he could be grateful when the pain was over His second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible There was no need of having a scene hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago It all came about so naturally that no one could complain and he knew that everybody would be pleased even Jo But when our first little passion has been crushed we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial so Laurie let the days pass enjoying every hour and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight and in the most graceful and decorous manner but it turned out exactly the reverse for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words They had been floating about all the morning from gloomy St Gingolf to sunny Montreux with the Alps of Savoy on one side Mont St Bernard and the Dent du Midi on the other pretty Vevay in the valley and Lausanne upon the hill beyond a cloudless blue sky overhead and the bluer lake below dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white winged gulls They had been talking of Bonnivard as they glided past Chillon and of Rousseau as they looked up at Clarens where he wrote his Heloise Neither had read it but they knew it was a love story and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own Amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them and when she looked up Laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily merely for the sake of saying something You must be tired Rest a little and let me row It will do me good for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious I m not tired but you may take an oar if you like There s room enough though I have to sit nearly in the middle else the boat won t trim returned Laurie as if he rather liked the arrangement Feeling that she had not mended matters much Amy took the offered third of a seat shook her hair over her face and accepted an oar She rowed as well as she did many other things and though she used both hands and Laurie but one the oars kept time and the boat went smoothly through the water How well we pull together don t we said Amy who objected to silence just then So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat Will you Amy very tenderly Yes Laurie very low Then they both stopped rowing and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake CHAPTER FORTY TWO ALL ALONE It was easy to promise self abnegation when self was wrapped up in another and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example But when the helpful voice was silent the daily lesson over the beloved presence gone and nothing remained but loneliness and grief then Jo found her promise very hard to keep How could she comfort Father and Mother when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister how could she make the house cheerful when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home for the new and where in all the world could she find some useful happy work to do that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward She tried in a blind hopeless way to do her duty secretly rebelling against it all the while for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened her burdens made heavier and life get harder and harder as she toiled along Some people seemed to get all sunshine and some all shadow It was not fair for she tried more than Amy to be good but never got any reward only disappointment trouble and hard work Poor Jo these were dark days to her for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house devoted to humdrum cares a few small pleasures and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier I can t do it I wasn t meant for a life like this and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if somebody doesn t come and help me she said to herself when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable But someone did come and help her though Jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity Often she started up at night thinking Beth called her and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow Oh Beth come back Come back she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain For as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister s faintest whisper her mother came to comfort her not with words only but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo s and broken whispers more eloquent than prayers because hopeful resignation went hand in hand with natural sorrow Sacred moments when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night turning affliction to a blessing which chastened grief and strengthened love Feeling this Jo s burden seemed easier to bear duty grew sweeter and life looked more endurable seen from the safe shelter of her mother s arms When aching heart was a little comforted troubled mind likewise found help for one day she went to the study and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile she said very humbly Father talk to me as you did to Beth I need it more than she did for I m all wrong My dear nothing can comfort me like this he answered with a falter in his voice and both arms round her as if he too needed help and did not fear to ask for it Then sitting in Beth s little chair close beside him Jo told her troubles the resentful sorrow for her loss the fruitless efforts that discouraged her the want of faith that made life look so dark and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair She gave him entire confidence he gave her the help she needed and both found consolation in the act For the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter but as man and woman able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love Happy thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called the church of one member and from which she came with fresh courage recovered cheerfulness and a more submissive spirit For the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power Other helps had Jo humble wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her and which she slowly learned to see and value Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been for Beth had presided over both and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush never thrown away As she used them Jo found herself humming the songs Beth used to hum imitating Beth s orderly ways and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy which was the first step toward making home happy though she didn t know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand You thoughtful creeter you re determined we shan t miss that dear lamb ef you can help it We don t say much but we see it and the Lord will bless you for t see ef He don t As they sat sewing together Jo discovered how much improved her sister Meg was how well she could talk how much she knew about good womanly impulses thoughts and feelings how happy she was in husband and children and how much they were all doing for each other Marriage is an excellent thing after all I wonder if I should blossom out half as well as you have if I tried it always perwisin I could said Jo as she constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy turvy nursery It s just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature Jo You are like a chestnut burr prickly outside but silky soft within and a sweet kernal if one can only get at it Love will make you show your heart one day and then the rough burr will fall off Frost opens chestnut burrs ma am and it takes a good shake to bring them down Boys go nutting and I don t care to be bagged by them returned Jo pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob Meg laughed for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo s old spirit but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her power and the sisterly chats were not wasted especially as two of Meg s most effective arguments were the babies whom Jo loved tenderly Grief is the best opener of some hearts and Jo s was nearly ready for the bag A little more sunshine to ripen the nut then not a boy s impatient shake but a man s hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr and find the kernal sound and sweet If she suspected this she would have shut up tight and been more prickly than ever fortunately she wasn t thinking about herself so when the time came down she dropped Now if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly renounced the world and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet with tracts in her pocket But you see Jo wasn t a heroine she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others and she just acted out her nature being sad cross listless or energetic as the mood suggested It s highly virtuous to say we ll be good but we can t do it all at once and it takes a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way Jo had got so far she was learning to do her duty and to feel unhappy if she did not but to do it cheerfully ah that was another thing She had often said she wanted to do something splendid no matter how hard and now she had her wish for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to Father and Mother trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort what could be harder for a restless ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes plans and desires and cheerfully live for others Providence had taken her at her word Here was the task not what she had expected but better because self had no part in it Now could she do it She decided that she would try and in her first attempt she found the helps I have suggested Still another was given her and she took it not as a reward but as a comfort as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested as he climbed the hill called Difficulty Why don t you write That always used to make you happy said her mother once when the desponding fit over shadowed Jo I ve no heart to write and if I had nobody cares for my things We do Write something for us and never mind the rest of the world Try it dear I m sure it would do you good and please us very much Don t believe I can But Jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her half finished manuscripts An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was scratching away with her black pinafore on and an absorbed expression which caused Mrs March to smile and slip away well pleased with the success of her suggestion Jo never knew how it happened but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it for when her family had laughed and cried over it her father sent it much against her will to one of the popular magazines and to her utter surprise it was not only paid for but others requested Letters from several persons whose praise was honor followed the appearance of the little story newspapers copied it and strangers as well as friends admired it For a small thing it was a great success and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once I don t understand it What can there be in a simple little story like that to make people praise it so she said quite bewildered There is truth in it Jo that s the secret Humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last You wrote with no thoughts of fame and money and put your heart into it my daughter You have had the bitter now comes the sweet Do your best and grow as happy as we are in your success If there is anything good or true in what I write it isn t mine I owe it all to you and Mother and Beth said Jo more touched by her father s words than by any amount of praise from the world So taught by love and sorrow Jo wrote her little stories and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers for they were kindly welcomed and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement Mrs March feared that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it but her fears were soon set at rest for though Jo looked grave at first she took it very quietly and was full of hopes and plans for the children before she read the letter twice It was a sort of written duet wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of for no one had any objection to make You like it Mother said Jo as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another Yes I hoped it would be so ever since Amy wrote that she had refused Fred I felt sure then that something better than what you call the mercenary spirit had come over her and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day How sharp you are Marmee and how silent You never said a word to me Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage I was half afraid to put the idea into your head lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled I m not the scatterbrain I was You may trust me I m sober and sensible enough for anyone s confidante now So you are my dear and I should have made you mine only I fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone else Now Mother did you really think I could be so silly and selfish after I d refused his love when it was freshest if not best I knew you were sincere then Jo but lately I have thought that if he came back and asked again you might perhaps feel like giving another answer Forgive me dear I can t help seeing that you are very lonely and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now No Mother it is better as it is and I m glad Amy has learned to love him But you are right in one thing I am lonely and perhaps if Teddy had tried again I might have said Yes not because I love him any more but because I care more to be loved than when he went away I m glad of that Jo for it shows that you are getting on There are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with Father and Mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward Mothers are the best lovers in the world but I don t mind whispering to Marmee that I d like to try all kinds It s very curious but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections the more I seem to want I d no idea hearts could take in so many Mine is so elastic it never seems full now and I used to be quite contented with my family I don t understand it I do and Mrs March smiled her wise smile as Jo turned back the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me He isn t sentimental doesn t say much about it but I see and feel it in all he says and does and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don t seem to be the same girl I was I never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now for he lets me read his heart and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes and am so proud to know it s mine He says he feels as if he could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate and lots of love for ballast I pray he may and try to be all he believes me for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might and never will desert him while God lets us be together Oh Mother I never knew how much like heaven this world could be when two people love and live for one another And that s our cool reserved and worldly Amy Truly love does work miracles How very very happy they must be and Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance which holds the reader fast till the end comes and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again By and by Jo roamed away upstairs for it was rainy and she could not walk A restless spirit possessed her and the old feeling came again not bitter as it once was but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked the other nothing It was not true she knew that and tried to put it away but the natural craving for affection was strong and Amy s happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to love with heart and soul and cling to while God let them be together Up in the garret where Jo s unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row each marked with its owners name and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all Jo glanced into them and when she came to her own leaned her chin on the edge and stared absently at the chaotic collection till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye She drew them out turned them over and relived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs Kirke s She had smiled at first then she looked thoughtful next sad and when she came to a little message written in the Professor s hand her lips began to tremble the books slid out of her lap and she sat looking at the friendly words as they took a new meaning and touched a tender spot in her heart Wait for me my friend I may be a little late but I shall surely come Oh if he only would So kind so good so patient with me always my dear old Fritz I didn t value him half enough when I had him but now how I should love to see him for everyone seems going away from me and I m all alone And holding the little paper fast as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag and cried as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof Was it all self pity loneliness or low spirits Or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer Who shall say CHAPTER FORTY THREE SURPRISES Jo was alone in the twilight lying on the old sofa looking at the fire and thinking It was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk No one disturbed her and she used to lie there on Beth s little red pillow planning stories dreaming dreams or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away Her face looked tired grave and rather sad for tomorrow was her birthday and she was thinking how fast the years went by how old she was getting and how little she seemed to have accomplished Almost twenty five and nothing to show for it Jo was mistaken in that There was a good deal to show and by and by she saw and was grateful for it An old maid that s what I m to be A literary spinster with a pen for a spouse a family of stories for children and twenty years hence a morsel of fame perhaps when like poor Johnson I m old and can t enjoy it solitary and can t share it independent and don t need it Well I needn t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner and I dare say old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it but and there Jo sighed as if the prospect was not inviting It seldom is at first and thirty seems the end of all things to five and twenty But it s not as bad as it looks and one can get on quite happily if one has something in one s self to fall back upon At twenty five girls begin to talk about being old maids but secretly resolve that they never will be At thirty they say nothing about it but quietly accept the fact and if sensible console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful happy years in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully Don t laugh at the spinsters dear girls for often very tender tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns and many silent sacrifices of youth health ambition love itself make the faded faces beautiful in God s sight Even the sad sour sisters should be kindly dealt with because they have missed the sweetest part of life if for no other reason And looking at them with compassion not contempt girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time That rosy cheeks don t last forever that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair and that by and by kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now Gentlemen which means boys be courteous to the old maids no matter how poor and plain and prim for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old protect the feeble and serve womankind regardless of rank age or color Just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed but nursed and petted too often without thanks the scrapes they have helped you out of the tips they have given you from their small store the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you the steps the willing old feet have taken and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live The bright eyed girls are quick to see such traits and will like you all the better for them and if death almost the only power that can part mother and son should rob you of yours you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for the best nevvy in the world Jo must have fallen asleep as I dare say my reader has during this little homily for suddenly Laurie s ghost seemed to stand before her a substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn t like to show it But like Jenny in the ballad She could not think it he and lay staring up at him in startled silence till he stooped and kissed her Then she knew him and flew up crying joyfully Oh my Teddy Oh my Teddy Dear Jo you are glad to see me then Glad My blessed boy words can t express my gladness Where s Amy Your mother has got her down at Meg s We stopped there by the way and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches Your what cried Jo for Laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him Oh the dickens Now I ve done it and he looked so guilty that Jo was down on him like a flash You ve gone and got married Yes please but I never will again and he went down upon his knees with a penitent clasping of hands and a face full of mischief mirth and triumph Actually married Very much so thank you Mercy on us What dreadful thing will you do next and Jo fell into her seat with a gasp A characteristic but not exactly complimentary congratulation returned Laurie still in an abject attitude but beaming with satisfaction What can you expect when you take one s breath away creeping in like a burglar and letting cats out of bags like that Get up you ridiculous boy and tell me all about it Not a word unless you let me come in my old place and promise not to barricade Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day and patted the sofa invitingly as she said in a cordial tone The old pillow is up garret and we don t need it now So come and fess Teddy How good it sounds to hear you say Teddy No one ever calls me that but you and Laurie sat down with an air of great content What does Amy call you My lord That s like her Well you look it and Jo s eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever The pillow was gone but there was a barricade nevertheless a natural one raised by time absence and change of heart Both felt it and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them It was gone directly however for Laurie said with a vain attempt at dignity Don t I look like a married man and the head of a family Not a bit and you never will You ve grown bigger and bonnier but you are the same scapegrace as ever Now really Jo you ought to treat me with more respect began Laurie who enjoyed it all immensely How can I when the mere idea of you married and settled is so irresistibly funny that I can t keep sober answered Jo smiling all over her face so infectiously that they had another laugh and then settled down for a good talk quite in the pleasant old fashion It s no use your going out in the cold to get Amy for they are all coming up presently I couldn t wait I wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise and have first skim as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream Of course you did and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end Now start right and tell me how it all happened I m pining to know Well I did it to please Amy began Laurie with a twinkle that made Jo exclaim Fib number one Amy did it to please you Go on and tell the truth if you can sir Now she s beginning to marm it Isn t it jolly to hear her said Laurie to the fire and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed It s all the same you know she and I being one We planned to come home with the Carrols a month or more ago but they suddenly changed their minds and decided to pass another winter in Paris But Grandpa wanted to come home He went to please me and I couldn t let him go alone neither could I leave Amy and Mrs Carrol had got English notions about chaperons and such nonsense and wouldn t let Amy come with us So I just settled the difficulty by saying Let s be married and then we can do as we like Of course you did You always have things to suit you Not always and something in Laurie s voice made Jo say hastily How did you ever get Aunt to agree It was hard work but between us we talked her over for we had heaps of good reasons on our side There wasn t time to write and ask leave but you all liked it had consented to it by and by and it was only taking time by the fetlock as my wife says Aren t we proud of those two words and don t we like to say them interrupted Jo addressing the fire in her turn and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last A trifle perhaps she s such a captivating little woman I can t help being proud of her Well then Uncle and Aunt were there to play propriety We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round so we did it When where how asked Jo in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity for she could not realize it a particle Six weeks ago at the American consul s in Paris a very quiet wedding of course for even in our happiness we didn t forget dear little Beth Jo put her hand in his as he said that and Laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow which he remembered well Why didn t you let us know afterward asked Jo in a quieter tone when they had sat quite still a minute We wanted to surprise you We thought we were coming directly home at first but the dear old gentleman as soon as we were married found he couldn t be ready under a month at least and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home so we went there and were as happy as people are but once in their lives My faith Wasn t it love among the roses Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute and Jo was glad of it for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten She tried to draw away her hand but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the half involuntary impulse Laurie held it fast and said with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before Jo dear I want to say one thing and then we ll put it by forever As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me I never shall stop loving you but the love is altered and I have learned to see that it is better as it is Amy and you changed places in my heart that s all I think it was meant to be so and would have come about naturally if I had waited as you tried to make me but I never could be patient and so I got a heartache I was a boy then headstrong and violent and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake For it was one Jo as you said and I found it out after making a fool of myself Upon my word I was so tumbled up in my mind at one time that I didn t know which I loved best you or Amy and tried to love you both alike But I couldn t and when I saw her in Switzerland everything seemed to clear up all at once You both got into your right places and I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife Amy and love them dearly Will you believe it and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another I ll believe it with all my heart but Teddy we never can be boy and girl again The happy old times can t come back and we mustn t expect it We are man and woman now with sober work to do for playtime is over and we must give up frolicking I m sure you feel this I see the change in you and you ll find it in me I shall miss my boy but I shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what I hoped he would We can t be little playmates any longer but we will be brother and sister to love and help one another all our lives won t we Laurie He did not say a word but took the hand she offered him and laid his face down on it for a minute feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion there had risen a beautiful strong friendship to bless them both Presently Jo said cheerfully for she didn t want the coming home to be a sad one I can t make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping Why it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning Amy s pinafore and pulling your hair when you teased Mercy me how time does fly As one of the children is older than yourself you needn t talk so like a grandma I flatter myself I m a gentleman growed as Peggotty said of David and when you see Amy you ll find her rather a precocious infant said Laurie looking amused at her maternal air You may be a little older in years but I m ever so much older in feeling Teddy Women always are and this last year has been such a hard one that I feel forty Poor Jo We left you to bear it alone while we went pleasuring You are older Here s a line and there s another Unless you smile your eyes look sad and when I touched the cushion just now I found a tear on it You ve had a great deal to bear and had to bear it all alone What a selfish beast I ve been and Laurie pulled his own hair with a remorseful look But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow and answered in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful No I had Father and Mother to help me and the dear babies to comfort me and the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy to make the troubles here easier to bear I am lonely sometimes but I dare say it s good for me and You never shall be again broke in Laurie putting his arm about her as if to fence out every human ill Amy and I can t get on without you so you must come and teach the children to keep house and go halves in everything just as we used to do and let us pet you and all be blissfully happy and friendly together If I shouldn t be in the way it would be very pleasant I begin to feel quite young already for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came You always were a comfort Teddy and Jo leaned her head on his shoulder just as she did years ago when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold on to him He looked down at her wondering if she remembered the time but Jo was smiling to herself as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming You are the same Jo still dropping tears about one minute and laughing the next You look a little wicked now What is it Grandma I was wondering how you and Amy get on together Like angels Yes of course but which rules I don t mind telling you that she does now at least I let her think so it pleases her you know By and by we shall take turns for marriage they say halves one s rights and doubles one s duties You ll go on as you begin and Amy will rule you all the days of your life Well she does it so imperceptibly that I don t think I shall mind much She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well In fact I rather like it for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it cried Jo with uplifted hands It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation as he replied with his high and mighty air Amy is too well bred for that and I am not the sort of man to submit to it My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel Jo liked that and thought the new dignity very becoming but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man and regret mingled with her pleasure I am sure of that Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to She is the sun and I the wind in the fable and the sun managed the man best you remember She can blow him up as well as shine on him laughed Laurie Such a lecture as I got at Nice I give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your scoldings a regular rouser I ll tell you all about it sometime she never will because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the good for nothing What baseness Well if she abuses you come to me and I ll defend you I look as if I needed it don t I said Laurie getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous as Amy s voice was heard calling Where is she Where s my dear old Jo In trooped the whole family and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again and after several vain attempts the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over Mr Laurence hale and hearty as ever was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone and the old fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever It was good to see him beam at my children as he called the young pair It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart and best of all to watch Laurie revolve about the two as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made The minute she put her eyes upon Amy Meg became conscious that her own dress hadn t a Parisian air that young Mrs Moffat would be entirely eclipsed by young Mrs Laurence and that her ladyship was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman Jo thought as she watched the pair How well they look together I was right and Laurie has found the beautiful accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old Jo and be a pride not a torment to him Mrs March and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces for they saw that their youngest had done well not only in worldly things but the better wealth of love confidence and happiness For Amy s face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart her voice had a new tenderness in it and the cool prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity both womanly and winning No little affectations marred it and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become Love has done much for our little girl said her mother softly She has had a good example before her all her life my dear Mr March whispered back with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her pitty aunty but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms Demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne A flank movement produced an unconditional surrender however for Laurie knew where to have him Young man when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul Blest if she ain t in silk from head to foot ain t it a relishin sight to see her settin there as fine as a fiddle and hear folks calling little Amy Mis Laurence muttered old Hannah who could not resist frequent peeks through the slide as she set the table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner Mercy on us how they did talk first one then the other then all burst out together trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour It was fortunate that tea was at hand to produce a lull and provide refreshment for they would have been hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer Such a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room Mr March proudly escorted Mrs Laurence Mrs March as proudly leaned on the arm of my son The old gentleman took Jo with a whispered You must be my girl now and a glance at the empty corner by the fire that made Jo whisper back I ll try to fill her place sir The twins pranced behind feeling that the millennium was at hand for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity Didn t they steal sips of tea stuff gingerbread ad libitum get a hot biscuit apiece and as a crowning trespass didn t they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets there to stick and crumble treacherously teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts and fearing that Dodo s sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty the little sinners attached themselves to Dranpa who hadn t his spectacles on Amy who was handed about like refreshments returned to the parlor on Father Laurence s arm The others paired off as before and this arrangement left Jo companionless She did not mind it at the minute for she lingered to answer Hannah s eager inquiry Will Miss Amy ride in her coop coupe and use all them lovely silver dishes that s stored away over yander Shouldn t wonder if she drove six white horses ate off gold plate and wore diamonds and point lace every day Teddy thinks nothing too good for her returned Jo with infinite satisfaction No more there is Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast asked Hannah who wisely mingled poetry and prose I don t care and Jo shut the door feeling that food was an uncongenial topic j
