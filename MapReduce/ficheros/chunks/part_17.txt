ll you come said Amy as she joined Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon Well yes but isn t it rather warm for such a long walk he answered slowly for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without I m going to have the little carriage and Baptiste can drive so you ll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice returned Amy with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids which were a weak point with Laurie Then I ll go with pleasure and he put out his hand for her sketchbook But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp Don t trouble yourself It s no exertion to me but you don t look equal to it Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch The two never quarreled Amy was too well bred and just now Laurie was too lazy so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air She answered him with a smile and they went on together in the most amicable manner It was a lovely drive along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight beauty loving eyes Here an ancient monastery whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them There a bare legged shepherd in wooden shoes pointed hat and rough jacket over one shoulder sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet Meek mouse colored donkeys laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went Brown soft eyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays or bunches of oranges still on the bough Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage fruit hung golden in the orchard and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside while beyond green slopes and craggy heights the Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky Valrosa well deserved its name for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere They overhung the archway thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to passers by and lined the avenue winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill Every shadowy nook where seats invited one to stop and rest was a mass of bloom every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson white or pale pink roses leaning down to smile at their own beauty Roses covered the walls of the house draped the cornices climbed the pillars and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean and the white walled city on its shore This is a regular honeymoon paradise isn t it Did you ever see such roses asked Amy pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by No nor felt such thorns returned Laurie with his thumb in his mouth after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach Try lower down and pick those that have no thorns said Amy gathering three of the tiny cream colored ones that starred the wall behind her She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression for in the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition and he was just then in that state of half sweet half bitter melancholy when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose for vivid flowers became her and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home The pale roses Amy gave him were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands never in bridal wreaths and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself but the next instant his American common sense got the better of sentimentality and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard since he came It s good advice you d better take it and save your fingers she said thinking her speech amused him Thank you I will he answered in jest and a few months later he did it in earnest Laurie when are you going to your grandfather she asked presently as she settled herself on a rustic seat Very soon You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks I dare say short answers save trouble He expects you and you really ought to go Hospitable creature I know it Then why don t you do it Natural depravity I suppose Natural indolence you mean It s really dreadful and Amy looked severe Not so bad as it seems for I should only plague him if I went so I might as well stay and plague you a little longer you can bear it better in fact I think it agrees with you excellently and Laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation but she had made up her mind to lecture that boy and in a minute she began again What are you doing just now Watching lizards No no I mean what do you intend and wish to do Smoke a cigarette if you ll allow me How provoking you are I don t approve of cigars and I will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch I need a figure With all the pleasure in life How will you have me full length or three quarters on my head or my heels I should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture then put yourself in also and call it Dolce far niente Stay as you are and go to sleep if you like I intend to work hard said Amy in her most energetic tone What delightful enthusiasm and he leaned against a tall urn with an air of entire satisfaction What would Jo say if she saw you now asked Amy impatiently hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister s name As usual Go away Teddy I m busy He laughed as he spoke but the laugh was not natural and a shade passed over his face for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet Both tone and shadow struck Amy for she had seen and heard them before and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on Laurie s face a hard bitter look full of pain dissatisfaction and regret It was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again She watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure thinking how like an Italian he looked as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb she said carefully tracing the well cut profile defined against the dark stone Wish I was That s a foolish wish unless you have spoiled your life You are so changed I sometimes think there Amy stopped with a half timid half wistful look more significant than her unfinished speech Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express and looking straight into her eyes said just as he used to say it to her mother It s all right ma am That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately It also touched her and she showed that it did by the cordial tone in which she said I m glad of that I didn t think you d been a very bad boy but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden Baden lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour Don t stay out there in the sun come and lie on the grass here and let us be friendly as Jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy s hat that lay there I m all ready for the secrets and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes I ve none to tell You may begin Haven t one to bless myself with I thought perhaps you d had some news from home You have heard all that has come lately Don t you hear often I fancied Jo would send you volumes She s very busy I m roving about so it s impossible to be regular you know When do you begin your great work of art Raphaella he asked changing the subject abruptly after another pause in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it Never she answered with a despondent but decided air Rome took all the vanity out of me for after seeing the wonders there I felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair Why should you with so much energy and talent That s just why because talent isn t genius and no amount of energy can make it so I want to be great or nothing I won t be a common place dauber so I don t intend to try any more And what are you going to do with yourself now if I may ask Polish up my other talents and be an ornament to society if I get the chance It was a characteristic speech and sounded daring but audacity becomes young people and Amy s ambition had a good foundation Laurie smiled but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a long cherished one died and spent no time lamenting Good And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in I fancy Amy preserved a discreet silence but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely Now I m going to play brother and ask questions May I I don t promise to answer Your face will if your tongue won t You aren t woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings my dear I heard rumors about Fred and you last year and it s my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long something would have come of it hey That s not for me to say was Amy s grim reply but her lips would smile and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge You are not engaged I hope and Laurie looked very elder brotherly and grave all of a sudden No But you will be if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees won t you Very likely Then you are fond of old Fred I could be if I tried But you don t intend to try till the proper moment Bless my soul what unearthly prudence He s a good fellow Amy but not the man I fancied you d like He is rich a gentleman and has delightful manners began Amy trying to be quite cool and dignified but feeling a little ashamed of herself in spite of the sincerity of her intentions I understand Queens of society can t get on without money so you mean to make a good match and start in that way Quite right and proper as the world goes but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother s girls True nevertheless A short speech but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker Laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain His look and silence as well as a certain inward self disapproval ruffled Amy and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay I wish you d do me the favor to rouse yourself a little she said sharply Do it for me there s a dear girl I could if I tried and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style Try then I give you leave returned Laurie who enjoyed having someone to tease after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime You d be angry in five minutes I m never angry with you It takes two flints to make a fire You are as cool and soft as snow You don t know what I can do Snow produces a glow and a tingle if applied rightly Your indifference is half affectation and a good stirring up would prove it Stir away it won t hurt me and it may amuse you as the big man said when his little wife beat him Regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet and beat till you are tired if that sort of exercise agrees with you Being decidedly nettled herself and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil and began Flo and I have got a new name for you It s Lazy Laurence How do you like it She thought it would annoy him but he only folded his arms under his head with an imperturbable That s not bad Thank you ladies Do you want to know what I honestly think of you Pining to be told Well I despise you If she had even said I hate you in a petulant or coquettish tone he would have laughed and rather liked it but the grave almost sad accent in her voice made him open his eyes and ask quickly Why if you please Because with every chance for being good useful and happy you are faulty lazy and miserable Strong language mademoiselle If you like it I ll go on Pray do it s quite interesting I thought you d find it so Selfish people always like to talk about themselves Am I selfish the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity Yes very selfish continued Amy in a calm cool voice twice as effective just then as an angry one I ll show you how for I ve studied you while we were frolicking and I m not at all satisfied with you Here you have been abroad nearly six months and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends Isn t a fellow to have any pleasure after a four year grind You don t look as if you d had much At any rate you are none the better for it as far as I can see I said when we first met that you had improved Now I take it all back for I don t think you half so nice as when I left you at home You have grown abominably lazy you like gossip and waste time on frivolous things you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people instead of being loved and respected by wise ones With money talent position health and beauty ah you like that old Vanity But it s the truth so I can t help saying it with all these splendid things to use and enjoy you can find nothing to do but dawdle and instead of being the man you ought to be you are only there she stopped with a look that had both pain and pity in it Saint Laurence on a gridiron added Laurie blandly finishing the sentence But the lecture began to take effect for there was a wide awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half angry half injured expression replaced the former indifference I supposed you d take it so You men tell us we are angels and say we can make you what we will but the instant we honestly try to do you good you laugh at us and won t listen which proves how much your flattery is worth Amy spoke bitterly and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet In a minute a hand came down over the page so that she could not draw and Laurie s voice said with a droll imitation of a penitent child I will be good oh I will be good But Amy did not laugh for she was in earnest and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil said soberly Aren t you ashamed of a hand like that It s as soft and white as a woman s and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin s best gloves and pick flowers for ladies You are not a dandy thank Heaven so I m glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it only the little old one Jo gave you so long ago Dear soul I wish she was here to help me So do I The hand vanished as suddenly as it came and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy She glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind but he was lying with his hat half over his face as if for shade and his mustache hid his mouth She only saw his chest rise and fall with a long breath that might have been a sigh and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of All in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy s mind and told her what her sister never had confided to her She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo she recalled the shadow on his face just now the change in his character and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration and now she was sure of it Her keen eyes filled and when she spoke again it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so I know I have no right to talk so to you Laurie and if you weren t the sweetest tempered fellow in the world you d be very angry with me But we are all so fond and proud of you I couldn t bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have been though perhaps they would understand the change better than I do I think they would came from under the hat in a grim tone quite as touching as a broken one They ought to have told me and not let me go blundering and scolding when I should have been more kind and patient than ever I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate her said artful Amy wishing to be sure of her facts this time Hang Miss Randal and Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady I beg pardon I thought and there she paused diplomatically No you didn t you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but Jo Laurie said that in his old impetuous tone and turned his face away as he spoke I did think so but as they never said anything about it and you came away I supposed I was mistaken And Jo wouldn t be kind to you Why I was sure she loved you dearly She was kind but not in the right way and it s lucky for her she didn t love me if I m the good for nothing fellow you think me It s her fault though and you may tell her so The hard bitter look came back again as he said that and it troubled Amy for she did not know what balm to apply I was wrong I didn t know I m very sorry I was so cross but I can t help wishing you d bear it better Teddy dear Don t that s her name for me and Laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo s half kind half reproachful tone Wait till you ve tried it yourself he added in a low voice as he pulled up the grass by the handful I d take it manfully and be respected if I couldn t be loved said Amy with the decision of one who knew nothing about it Now Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well making no moan asking no sympathy and taking his trouble away to live it down alone Amy s lecture put the matter in a new light and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure and shut himself up in moody indifference He felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again Presently he sat up and asked slowly Do you think Jo would despise me as you do Yes if she saw you now She hates lazy people Why don t you do something splendid and make her love you I did my best but it was no use Graduating well you mean That was no more than you ought to have done for your grandfather s sake It would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money when everyone knew that you could do well I did fail say what you will for Jo wouldn t love me began Laurie leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude No you didn t and you ll say so in the end for it did you good and proved that you could do something if you tried If you d only set about another task of some sort you d soon be your hearty happy self again and forget your trouble That s impossible Try it and see You needn t shrug your shoulders and think Much she knows about such things I don t pretend to be wise but I am observing and I see a great deal more than you d imagine I m interested in other people s experiences and inconsistencies and though I can t explain I remember and use them for my own benefit Love Jo all your days if you choose but don t let it spoil you for it s wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can t have the one you want There I won t lecture any more for I know you ll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl Neither spoke for several minutes Laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked Presently she put it on his knee merely saying How do you like that He looked and then he smiled as he could not well help doing for it was capitally done the long lazy figure on the grass with listless face half shut eyes and one hand holding a cigar from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer s head How well you draw he said with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill adding with a half laugh Yes that s me As you are This is as you were and Amy laid another sketch beside the one he held It was not nearly so well done but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young man s face as he looked Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse Hat and coat were off and every line of the active figure resolute face and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning The handsome brute just subdued stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein with one foot impatiently pawing the ground and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him In the ruffled mane the rider s breezy hair and erect attitude there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion of strength courage and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the Dolce far Niente sketch Laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him That satisfied her and without waiting for him to speak she said in her sprightly way Don t you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck and we all looked on Meg and Beth were frightened but Jo clapped and pranced and I sat on the fence and drew you I found that sketch in my portfolio the other day touched it up and kept it to show you Much obliged You ve improved immensely since then and I congratulate you May I venture to suggest in a honeymoon paradise that five o clock is the dinner hour at your hotel Laurie rose as he spoke returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end He tried to resume his former easy indifferent air but it was an affectation now for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess Amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner and said to herself Now I ve offended him Well if it does him good I m glad if it makes him hate me I m sorry but it s true and I can t take back a word of it They laughed and chatted all the way home and little Baptiste up behind thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits But both felt ill at ease The friendly frankness was disturbed the sunshine had a shadow over it and despite their apparent gaiety there was a secret discontent in the heart of each Shall we see you this evening mon frere asked Amy as they parted at her aunt s door Unfortunately I have an engagement Au revoir madamoiselle and Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand in the foreign fashion which became him better than many men Something in his face made Amy say quickly and warmly No be yourself with me Laurie and part in the good old way I d rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental salutations in France Goodbye dear and with these words uttered in the tone she liked Laurie left her after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness Next morning instead of the usual call Amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end My Dear Mentor Please make my adieux to your aunt and exult within yourself for Lazy Laurence has gone to his grandpa like the best of boys A pleasant winter to you and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser Tell him so with my congratulations Yours gratefully Telemachus Good boy I m glad he s gone said Amy with an approving smile The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room adding with an involuntary sigh Yes I am glad but how I shall miss him CHAPTER FORTY THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW When the first bitterness was over the family accepted the inevitable and tried to bear it cheerfully helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble They put away their grief and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth and in it was gathered everything that she most loved flowers pictures her piano the little worktable and the beloved pussies Father s best books found their way there Mother s easy chair Jo s desk Amy s finest sketches and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage to make sunshine for Aunty Beth John quietly set apart a little sum that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for Old Hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite dropping tears as she worked and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter Here cherished like a household saint in its shrine sat Beth tranquil and busy as ever for nothing could change the sweet unselfish nature and even while preparing to leave life she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind The feeble fingers were never idle and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school children daily passing to and fro to drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks scrapbooks for picture loving eyes and all manner of pleasant devices till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers as it were and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother who sat above there and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs If Beth had wanted any reward she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window with nods and smiles and the droll little letters which came to her full of blots and gratitude The first few months were very happy ones and Beth often used to look round and say How beautiful this is as they all sat together in her sunny room the babies kicking and crowing on the floor mother and sisters working near and father reading in his pleasant voice from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words as applicable now as when written centuries ago a little chapel where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn trying to show them that hope can comfort love and faith make resignation possible Simple sermons that went straight to the souls of those who listened for the father s heart was in the minister s religion and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come for by and by Beth said the needle was so heavy and put it down forever Talking wearied her faces troubled her pain claimed her for its own and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh Ah me Such heavy days such long long nights such aching hearts and imploring prayers when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly to hear the bitter cry Help me help me and to feel that there was no help A sad eclipse of the serene soul a sharp struggle of the young life with death but both were mercifully brief and then the natural rebellion over the old peace returned more beautiful than ever With the wreck of her frail body Beth s soul grew strong and though she said little those about her felt that she was ready saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest and waited with her on the shore trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said I feel stronger when you are here She slept on a couch in the room waking often to renew the fire to feed lift or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything and tried not to be a trouble All day she haunted the room jealous of any other nurse and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her Precious and helpful hours to Jo for now her heart received the teaching that it needed Lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them charity for all the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy and the sincere faith that fears nothing but trusts undoubtingly Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well worn little book heard her singing softly to beguile the sleepless night or saw her lean her face upon her hands while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears feeling that Beth in her simple unselfish way was trying to wean herself from the dear old life and fit herself for the life to come by sacred words of comfort quiet prayers and the music she loved so well Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons the saintliest hymns the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter For with eyes made clear by many tears and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow she recognized the beauty of her sister s life uneventful unambitious yet full of the genuine virtues which smell sweet and blossom in the dust the self forgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven the true success which is possible to all One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain as she turned the leaves of her old favorite Pilgrims s Progress she found a little paper scribbled over in Jo s hand The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it Poor Jo She s fast asleep so I won t wake her to ask leave She shows me all her things and I don t think she ll mind if I look at this thought Beth with a glance at her sister who lay on the rug with the tongs beside her ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart MY BETH Sitting patient in the shadow Till the blessed light shall come A serene and saintly presence Sanctifies our troubled home Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows Break like ripples on the strand Of the deep and solemn river Where her willing feet now stand O my sister passing from me Out of human care and strife Leave me as a gift those virtues Which have beautified your life Dear bequeath me that great patience Which has power to sustain A cheerful uncomplaining spirit In its prison house of pain Give me for I need it sorely Of that courage wise and sweet Which has made the path of duty Green beneath your willing feet Give me that unselfish nature That with charity divine Can pardon wrong for love s dear sake Meek heart forgive me mine Thus our parting daily loseth Something of its bitter pain And while learning this hard lesson My great loss becomes my gain For the touch of grief will render My wild nature more serene Give to life new aspirations A new trust in the unseen Henceforth safe across the river I shall see forever more A beloved household spirit Waiting for me on the shore Hope and faith born of my sorrow Guardian angels shall become And the sister gone before me By their hands shall lead me home Blurred and blotted faulty and feeble as the lines were they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth s face for her one regret had been that she had done so little and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless that her death would not bring the despair she feared As she sat with the paper folded between her hands the charred log fell asunder Jo started up revived the blaze and crept to the bedside hoping Beth slept Not asleep but so happy dear See I found this and read it I knew you wouldn t care Have I been all that to you Jo she asked with wistful humble earnestness Oh Beth so much so much and Jo s head went down upon the pillow beside her sister s Then I don t feel as if I d wasted my life I m not so good as you make me but I have tried to do right And now when it s too late to begin even to do better it s such a comfort to know that someone loves me so much and feels as if I d helped them More than any one in the world Beth I used to think I couldn t let you go but I m learning to feel that I don t lose you that you ll be more to me than ever and death can t part us though it seems to I know it cannot and I don t fear it any longer for I m sure I shall be your Beth still to love and help you more than ever You must take my place Jo and be everything to Father and Mother when I m gone They will turn to you don t fail them and if it s hard to work alone remember that I don t forget you and that you ll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go and it makes the end so easy I ll try Beth and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition pledged herself to a new and better one acknowledging the poverty of other desires and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the immortality of love So the spring days came and went the sky grew clearer the earth greener the flowers were up fairly early and the birds came back in time to say goodbye to Beth who like a tired but trustful child clung to the hands that had led her all her life as Father and Mother guided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow and gave her up to God Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words see visions or depart with beatified countenances and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep As Beth had hoped the tide went out easily and in the dark hour before dawn on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath she quietly drew her last with no farewell but one loving look one little sigh With tears and prayers and tender hands Mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel not a phantom full of dread When morning came for the first time in many months the fire was out Jo s place was empty and the room was very still But a bird sang blithely on a budding bough close by the snowdrops blossomed freshly at the window and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears and thanked God that Beth was well at last CHAPTER FORTY ONE LEARNING TO FORGET Amy s lecture did Laurie good though of course he did not own it till long afterward Men seldom do for when women are the advisers the lords of creation don t take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do Then they act upon it and if it succeeds they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it If it fails they generously give her the whole Laurie went back to his grandfather and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully and he had better try it again There was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received Pride forbid and whenever the longing grew very strong he fortified his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impression I despise you Go and do something splendid that will make her love you Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy but then when a man has a great sorrow he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down He felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now and though he should never cease to be a faithful mourner there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously Jo wouldn t love him but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girl s No had not spoiled his life He had always meant to do something and Amy s advice was quite unnecessary He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred That being done he felt that he was ready to hide his stricken heart and still toil on As Goethe when he had a joy or a grief put it into a song so Laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music and to compose a Requiem which should harrow up Jo s soul and melt the heart of every hearer Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off he went to Vienna where he had musical friends and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself But whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe he soon discovered that the Requiem was beyond him just at present It was evident that his mind was not in working order yet and his ideas needed clarifying for often in the middle of a plaintive strain he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice especially the stout Frenchman and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being Then he tried an opera for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him He wanted Jo for his heroine and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love But memory turned traitor and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl would only recall Jo s oddities faults and freaks would only show her in the most unsentimental aspects beating mats with her head tied up in a bandanna barricading herself with the sofa pillow or throwing cold water over his passion a la Gummidge and an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint Jo wouldn t be put into the opera at any price and he had to give her up with a Bless that girl what a torment she is and a clutch at his hair as became a distracted composer When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody memory produced one with the most obliging readiness This phantom wore many faces but it always had golden hair was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud and floated airily before his mind s eye in a pleasing chaos of roses peacocks white ponies and blue ribbons He did not give the complacent wraith any name but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her as well he might for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun and escorted her unscathed through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman Thanks to this inspiration he got on swimmingly for a time but gradually the work lost its charm and he forgot to compose while he sat musing pen in hand or roamed about the gay city to get some new ideas and refresh his mind which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter He did not do much but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself It s genius simmering perhaps I ll let it simmer and see what comes of it he said with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasn t genius but something far more common Whatever it was it simmered to some purpose for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory life began to long for some real and earnest work to go at soul and body and finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music was not a composer Returning from one of Mozart s grand operas splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre he looked over his own played a few of the best parts sat staring at the busts of Mendelssohn Beethoven and Bach who stared benignly back again Then suddenly he tore up his music sheets one by one and as the last fluttered out of his hand he said soberly to himself She is right Talent isn t genius and you can t make it so That music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her and I won t be a humbug any longer Now what shall I do That seemed a hard question to answer and Laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread Now if ever occurred an eligible opportunity for going to the devil as he once forcibly expressed it for he had plenty of money and nothing to do and Satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and idle hands The poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within but he withstood them pretty well for much as he valued liberty he valued good faith and confidence more so his promise to his grandfather and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him and say All s well kept him safe and steady Very likely some Mrs Grundy will observe I don t believe it boys will be boys young men must sow their wild oats and women must not expect miracles I dare say you don t Mrs Grundy but it s true nevertheless Women work a good many miracles and I have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings Let the boys be boys the longer the better and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must But mothers sisters and friends may help to make the crop a small one and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest by believing and showing that they believe in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good women s eyes If it is a feminine delusion leave us to enjoy it while we may for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our hopes of the brave tenderhearted little lads who still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb all his powers for years but to his great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day He refused to believe it at first got angry with himself and couldn t understand it but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things and time and nature work their will in spite of us Laurie s heart wouldn t ache The wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him and instead of trying to forget he found himself trying to remember He had not foreseen this turn of affairs and was not prepared for it He was disgusted with himself surprised at his own fickleness and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love but they refused to burst into a blaze There was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment very tender a little sad and resentful still but that was sure to pass away in time leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end As the word brotherly passed through his mind in one of his reveries he smiled and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before him Well he was a great man and when he couldn t have one sister he took the other and was happy Laurie did not utter the words but he thought them and the next instant kissed the little old ring saying to himself No I won t I haven t forgotten I never can I ll try again and if that fails why then Leaving his sentence unfinished he seized pen and paper and wrote to Jo telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind Couldn t she wouldn t she and let him come home and be happy While waiting for an answer he did nothing but he did it energetically for he was in a fever of impatience It came at last and settled his mind effectually on one point for Jo decidedly couldn t and wouldn t She was wrapped up in Beth and never wished to hear the word love again Then she begged him to be happy with somebody else but always keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister Jo In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was worse she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay That would be time enough please God but Laurie must write to her often and not let her feel lonely homesick or anxious So I will at once Poor little girl it will be a sad going home for her I m afraid and Laurie opened his desk as if writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before But he did not write the letter that day for as he rummaged out his best paper he came across something which changed his purpose Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills passports and business documents of various kinds were several of Jo s letters and in another compartment were three notes from Amy carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside With a half repentant half amused expression Laurie gathered up all Jo s letters smoothed folded and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger then slowly drew it off laid it with the letters locked the drawer and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan s feeling as if there had been a funeral and though not overwhelmed with affliction this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies The letter went very soon however and was promptly answered for Amy was homesick and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner The correspondence flourished famously and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring Laurie sold his busts made allumettes of his opera and went back to Paris hoping somebody would arrive before long He wanted desperately to go to Nice but would not till he was asked and Amy would not ask him for just then she was having little experiences of her own which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of our boy Fred Vaughn had returned and put the question to which she had once decided to answer Yes thank you but now she said No thank you kindly but steadily for when the time came her courage failed her and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears The words Fred is a good fellow but not at all the man I fancied you would ever like and Laurie s face when he uttered them kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look if not in words I shall marry for money It troubled her to remember that now she wished she could take it back it sounded so unwomanly She didn t want Laurie to think her a heartless worldly creature She didn t care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman She was so glad he didn t hate her for the dreadful things she said but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever His letters were such a comfort for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come It was not only a pleasure but a duty to answer them for the poor fellow was forlorn and needed petting since Jo persisted in being stonyhearted She ought to have made an effort and tried to love him It couldn t be very hard many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them But Jo never would act like other girls so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings than they are Amy never lectured now She asked his opinion on all subjects she was interested in everything he did made charming little presents for him and sent him two letters a week full of lively gossip sisterly confidences and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their sister s pockets read and reread diligently cried over when short kissed when long and treasured carefully we will not hint that Amy did any of these fond and foolish things But sh
