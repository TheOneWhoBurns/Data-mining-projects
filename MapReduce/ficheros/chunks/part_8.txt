 haven t said Jo decidedly Which will you have Beth There ain t no need of but one aid Hannah Jo please And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look which effectually settled that point I ll go and tell Amy said Meg feeling a little hurt yet rather relieved on the whole for she did not like nursing and Jo did Amy rebelled outright and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March Meg reasoned pleaded and commanded all in vain Amy protested that she would not go and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done Before she came back Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing with her head in the sofa cushions She told her story expecting to be consoled but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room whistling softly as he knit his brows in deep thought Presently he sat down beside her and said in his most wheedlesome tone Now be a sensible little woman and do as they say No don t cry but hear what a jolly plan I ve got You go to Aunt March s and I ll come and take you out every day driving or walking and we ll have capital times Won t that be better than moping here I don t wish to be sent off as if I was in the way began Amy in an injured voice Bless your heart child it s to keep you well You don t want to be sick do you No I m sure I don t but I dare say I shall be for I ve been with Beth all the time That s the very reason you ought to go away at once so that you may escape it Change of air and care will keep you well I dare say or if it does not entirely you will have the fever more lightly I advise you to be off as soon as you can for scarlet fever is no joke miss But it s dull at Aunt March s and she is so cross said Amy looking rather frightened It won t be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is and take you out gallivanting The old lady likes me and I ll be as sweet as possible to her so she won t peck at us whatever we do Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck On my honor as a gentleman And come every single day See if I don t And bring me back the minute Beth is well The identical minute And go to the theater truly A dozen theaters if we may Well I guess I will said Amy slowly Good girl Call Meg and tell her you ll give in said Laurie with an approving pat which annoyed Amy more than the giving in Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought and Amy feeling very precious and self sacrificing promised to go if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill How is the little dear asked Laurie for Beth was his especial pet and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show She is lying down on Mother s bed and feels better The baby s death troubled her but I dare say she has only got cold Hannah says she thinks so but she looks worried and that makes me fidgety answered Meg What a trying world it is said Jo rumpling up her hair in a fretful way No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another There doesn t seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother s gone so I m all at sea Well don t make a porcupine of yourself it isn t becoming Settle your wig Jo and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother or do anything asked Laurie who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friend s one beauty That is what troubles me said Meg I think we ought to tell her if Beth is really ill but Hannah says we mustn t for Mother can t leave Father and it will only make them anxious Beth won t be sick long and Hannah knows just what to do and Mother said we were to mind her so I suppose we must but it doesn t seem quite right to me Hum well I can t say Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor has been We will Jo go and get Dr Bangs at once commanded Meg We can t decide anything till he has been Stay where you are Jo I m errand boy to this establishment said Laurie taking up his cap I m afraid you are busy began Meg No I ve done my lessons for the day Do you study in vacation time asked Jo I follow the good example my neighbors set me was Laurie s answer as he swung himself out of the room I have great hopes for my boy observed Jo watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile He does very well for a boy was Meg s somewhat ungracious answer for the subject did not interest her Dr Bangs came said Beth had symptoms of the fever but he thought she would have it lightly though he looked sober over the Hummel story Amy was ordered off at once and provided with something to ward off danger she departed in great state with Jo and Laurie as escort Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality What do you want now she asked looking sharply over her spectacles while the parrot sitting on the back of her chair called out Go away No boys allowed here Laurie retired to the window and Jo told her story No more than I expected if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn t sick which I ve no doubt she will be looks like it now Don t cry child it worries me to hear people sniff Amy was on the point of crying but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot s tail which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out Bless my boots in such a funny way that she laughed instead What do you hear from your mother asked the old lady gruffly Father is much better replied Jo trying to keep sober Oh is he Well that won t last long I fancy March never had any stamina was the cheerful reply Ha ha Never say die take a pinch of snuff goodbye goodbye squalled Polly dancing on her perch and clawing at the old lady s cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear Hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird And Jo you d better go at once It isn t proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like Hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird cried Polly tumbling off the chair with a bounce and running to peck the rattlepated boy who was shaking with laughter at the last speech I don t think I can bear it but I ll try thought Amy as she was left alone with Aunt March Get along you fright screamed Polly and at that rude speech Amy could not restrain a sniff CHAPTER EIGHTEEN DARK DAYS Beth did have the fever and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and the doctor suspected The girls knew nothing about illness and Mr Laurence was not allowed to see her so Hannah had everything her own way and busy Dr Bangs did his best but left a good deal to the excellent nurse Meg stayed at home lest she should infect the Kings and kept house feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of Beth s illness She could not think it right to deceive her mother but she had been bidden to mind Hannah and Hannah wouldn t hear of Mrs March bein told and worried just for sech a trifle Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night not a hard task for Beth was very patient and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself But there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse broken voice to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her but addressed them by wrong names and called imploringly for her mother Then Jo grew frightened Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth and even Hannah said she would think of it though there was no danger yet A letter from Washington added to their trouble for Mr March had had a relapse and could not think of coming home for a long while How dark the days seemed now how sad and lonely the house and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home Then it was that Margaret sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buy in love protection peace and health the real blessings of life Then it was that Jo living in the darkened room with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of Beth s nature to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts and to acknowledge the worth of Beth s unselfish ambition to live for others and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess and which all should love and value more than talent wealth or beauty And Amy in her exile longed eagerly to be at home that she might work for Beth feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome and remembering with regretful grief how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost and Mr Laurence locked the grand piano because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him Everyone missed Beth The milkman baker grocer and butcher inquired how she did poor Mrs Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for Minna the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little Beth had made Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege She longed for her cats but would not have them brought lest they should get sick and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo She sent loving messages to Amy bade them tell her mother that she would write soon and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word that Father might not think she had neglected him But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended and she lay hour after hour tossing to and fro with incoherent words on her lips or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment Dr Bangs came twice a day Hannah sat up at night Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute and Jo never stirred from Beth s side The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them for a bitter wind blew snow fell fast and the year seemed getting ready for its death When Dr Bangs came that morning he looked long at Beth held the hot hand in both his own for a minute and laid it gently down saying in a low voice to Hannah If Mrs March can leave her husband she d better be sent for Hannah nodded without speaking for her lips twitched nervously Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words and Jo standing with a pale face for a minute ran to the parlor snatched up the telegram and throwing on her things rushed out into the storm She was soon back and while noiselessly taking off her cloak Laurie came in with a letter saying that Mr March was mending again Jo read it thankfully but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly What is it Is Beth worse I ve sent for Mother said Jo tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression Good for you Jo Did you do it on your own responsibility asked Laurie as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots seeing how her hands shook No The doctor told us to Oh Jo it s not so bad as that cried Laurie with a startled face Yes it is She doesn t know us she doesn t even talk about the flocks of green doves as she calls the vine leaves on the wall She doesn t look like my Beth and there s nobody to help us bear it Mother and father both gone and God seems so far away I can t find Him As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo s cheeks she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way as if groping in the dark and Laurie took it in his whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat I m here Hold on to me Jo dear She could not speak but she did hold on and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart and seemed to lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable but no fitting words came to him so he stood silent gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do It was the best thing he could have done far more soothing than the most eloquent words for Jo felt the unspoken sympathy and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her and looked up with a grateful face Thank you Teddy I m better now I don t feel so forlorn and will try to bear it if it comes Keep hoping for the best that will help you Jo Soon your mother will be here and then everything will be all right I m so glad Father is better Now she won t feel so bad about leaving him Oh me It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders sighed Jo spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry Doesn t Meg pull fair asked Laurie looking indignant Oh yes she tries to but she can t love Bethy as I do and she won t miss her as I shall Beth is my conscience and I can t give her up I can t I can t Down went Jo s face into the wet handkerchief and she cried despairingly for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear Laurie drew his hand across his eyes but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips It might be unmanly but he couldn t help it and I am glad of it Presently as Jo s sobs quieted he said hopefully I don t think she will die She s so good and we all love her so much I don t believe God will take her away yet The good and dear people always do die groaned Jo but she stopped crying for her friend s words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears Poor girl you re worn out It isn t like you to be forlorn Stop a bit I ll hearten you up in a jiffy Laurie went off two stairs at a time and Jo laid her wearied head down on Beth s little brown hood which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it It must have possessed some magic for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo and when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine she took it with a smile and said bravely I drink Health to my Beth You are a good doctor Teddy and such a comfortable friend How can I ever pay you she added as the wine refreshed her body as the kind words had done her troubled mind I ll send my bill by and by and tonight I ll give you something that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine said Laurie beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something What is it cried Jo forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder I telegraphed to your mother yesterday and Brooke answered she d come at once and she ll be here tonight and everything will be all right Aren t you glad I did it Laurie spoke very fast and turned red and excited all in a minute for he had kept his plot a secret for fear of disappointing the girls or harming Beth Jo grew quite white flew out of her chair and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck and crying out with a joyful cry Oh Laurie Oh Mother I am so glad She did not weep again but laughed hysterically and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news Laurie though decidedly amazed behaved with great presence of mind He patted her back soothingly and finding that she was recovering followed it up by a bashful kiss or two which brought Jo round at once Holding on to the banisters she put him gently away saying breathlessly Oh don t I didn t mean to it was dreadful of me but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn t help flying at you Tell me all about it and don t give me wine again it makes me act so I don t mind laughed Laurie as he settled his tie Why you see I got fidgety and so did Grandpa We thought Hannah was overdoing the authority business and your mother ought to know She d never forgive us if Beth Well if anything happened you know So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something and off I pelted to the office yesterday for the doctor looked sober and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram I never can bear to be lorded over so that settled my mind and I did it Your mother will come I know and the late train is in at two A M I shall go for her and you ve only got to bottle up your rapture and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here Laurie you re an angel How shall I ever thank you Fly at me again I rather liked it said Laurie looking mischievous a thing he had not done for a fortnight No thank you I ll do it by proxy when your grandpa comes Don t tease but go home and rest for you ll be up half the night Bless you Teddy bless you Jo had backed into a corner and as she finished her speech she vanished precipitately into the kitchen where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was happy oh so happy while Laurie departed feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it That s the interferingest chap I ever see but I forgive him and do hope Mrs March is coming right away said Hannah with an air of relief when Jo told the good news Meg had a quiet rapture and then brooded over the letter while Jo set the sickroom in order and Hannah knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change Beth s bird began to chirp again and a half blown rose was discovered on Amy s bush in the window The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness and every time the girls met their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another whispering encouragingly Mother s coming dear Mother s coming Every one rejoiced but Beth She lay in that heavy stupor alike unconscious of hope and joy doubt and danger It was a piteous sight the once rosy face so changed and vacant the once busy hands so weak and wasted the once smiling lips quite dumb and the once pretty well kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow All day she lay so only rousing now and then to mutter Water with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word All day Jo and Meg hovered over her watching waiting hoping and trusting in God and Mother and all day the snow fell the bitter wind raged and the hours dragged slowly by But night came at last and every time the clock struck the sisters still sitting on either side of the bed looked at each other with brightening eyes for each hour brought help nearer The doctor had been in to say that some change for better or worse would probably take place about midnight at which time he would return Hannah quite worn out lay down on the sofa at the bed s foot and fell fast asleep Mr Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs March s countenance as she entered Laurie lay on the rug pretending to rest but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear The girls never forgot that night for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those If God spares Beth I never will complain again whispered Meg earnestly If God spares Beth I ll try to love and serve Him all my life answered Jo with equal fervor I wish I had no heart it aches so sighed Meg after a pause If life is often as hard as this I don t see how we ever shall get through it added her sister despondently Here the clock struck twelve and both forgot themselves in watching Beth for they fancied a change passed over her wan face The house was still as death and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush Weary Hannah slept on and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed An hour went by and nothing happened except Laurie s quiet departure for the station Another hour still no one came and anxious fears of delay in the storm or accidents by the way or worst of all a great grief at Washington haunted the girls It was past two when Jo who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow heard a movement by the bed and turning quickly saw Meg kneeling before their mother s easy chair with her face hidden A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo as she thought Beth is dead and Meg is afraid to tell me She was back at her post in an instant and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place The fever flush and the look of pain were gone and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips and softly whispered Good by my Beth Good by As if awaked by the stir Hannah started out of her sleep hurried to the bed looked at Beth felt her hands listened at her lips and then throwing her apron over her head sat down to rock to and fro exclaiming under her breath The fever s turned she s sleepin nat ral her skin s damp and she breathes easy Praise be given Oh my goodness me Before the girls could believe the happy truth the doctor came to confirm it He was a homely man but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said with a fatherly look at them Yes my dears I think the little girl will pull through this time Keep the house quiet let her sleep and when she wakes give her What they were to give neither heard for both crept into the dark hall and sitting on the stairs held each other close rejoicing with hearts too full for words When they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah they found Beth lying as she used to do with her cheek pillowed on her hand the dreadful pallor gone and breathing quietly as if just fallen asleep If Mother would only come now said Jo as the winter night began to wane See said Meg coming up with a white half opened rose I thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth s hand tomorrow if she went away from us But it has blossomed in the night and now I mean to put it in my vase here so that when the darling wakes the first thing she sees will be the little rose and Mother s face Never had the sun risen so beautifully and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo as they looked out in the early morning when their long sad vigil was done It looks like a fairy world said Meg smiling to herself as she stood behind the curtain watching the dazzling sight Hark cried Jo starting to her feet Yes there was a sound of bells at the door below a cry from Hannah and then Laurie s voice saying in a joyful whisper Girls she s come She s come CHAPTER NINETEEN AMY S WILL While these things were happening at home Amy was having hard times at Aunt March s She felt her exile deeply and for the first time in her life realized how much she was beloved and petted at home Aunt March never petted any one she did not approve of it but she meant to be kind for the well behaved little girl pleased her very much and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew s children though she didn t think it proper to confess it She really did her best to make Amy happy but dear me what mistakes she made Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs can sympathize with children s little cares and joys make them feel at home and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way But Aunt March had not this gift and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders her prim ways and long prosy talks Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract as far as possible the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence So she took Amy by the hand and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago a process which carried dismay to Amy s soul and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider She had to wash the cups every morning and polish up the old fashioned spoons the fat silver teapot and the glasses till they shone Then she must dust the room and what a trying job that was Not a speck escaped Aunt March s eye and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving which was never dusted to suit Then Polly had to be fed the lap dog combed and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair After these tiresome labors she must do her lessons which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed Then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play and didn t she enjoy it Laurie came every day and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to go out with him when they walked and rode and had capital times After dinner she had to read aloud and sit still while the old lady slept which she usually did for an hour as she dropped off over the first page Then patchwork or towels appeared and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime The evenings were the worst of all for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her youth which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go to bed intending to cry over her hard fate but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two If it had not been for Laurie and old Esther the maid she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted for he soon felt that she did not admire him and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible He pulled her hair whenever she came near him upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage made Mop bark by pecking at him while Madam dozed called her names before company and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird Then she could not endure the dog a fat cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat which was about a dozen times a day The cook was bad tempered the old coachman was deaf and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady Esther was a Frenchwoman who had lived with Madame as she called her mistress for many years and who rather tyrannized over the old lady who could not get along without her Her real name was Estelle but Aunt March ordered her to change it and she obeyed on condition that she was never asked to change her religion She took a fancy to Mademoiselle and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in France when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame s laces She also allowed her to roam about the great house and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie Amy s chief delight was an Indian cabinet full of queer drawers little pigeonholes and secret places in which were kept all sorts of ornaments some precious some merely curious all more or less antique To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction especially the jewel cases in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day her lover s diamonds the jet mourning rings and pins the queer lockets with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn Uncle March s big watch with the red seal so many childish hands had played with and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March s wedding ring too small now for her fat finger but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will asked Esther who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables I like the diamonds best but there is no necklace among them and I m fond of necklaces they are so becoming I should choose this if I might replied Amy looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same I too covet that but not as a necklace Ah no To me it is a rosary and as such I should use it like a good catholic said Esther eyeing the handsome thing wistfully Is it meant to use as you use the string of good smelling wooden beads hanging over your glass asked Amy Truly yes to pray with It would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this instead of wearing it as a vain bijou You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers Esther and always come down looking quiet and satisfied I wish I could If Mademoiselle was a Catholic she would find true comfort but as that is not to be it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame She had a little chapel and in it found solacement for much trouble Would it be right for me to do so too asked Amy who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort and found that she was apt to forget her little book now that Beth was not there to remind her of it It would be excellent and charming and I shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it Say nothing to Madame but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts and pray the dear God preserve your sister Esther was truly pious and quite sincere in her advice for she had an affectionate heart and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety Amy liked the idea and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room hoping it would do her good I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March dies she said as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one To you and your sisters I know it Madame confides in me I witnessed her will and it is to be so whispered Esther smiling How nice But I wish she d let us have them now Procrastination is not agreeable observed Amy taking a last look at the diamonds It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things The first one who is affianced will have the pearls Madame has said it and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners Do you think so Oh I ll be a lamb if I can only have that lovely ring It s ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant s I do like Aunt March after all And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it From that day she was a model of obedience and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training Esther fitted up the closet with a little table placed a footstool before it and over it a picture taken from one of the shut up rooms She thought it was of no great value but being appropriate she borrowed it well knowing that Madame would never know it nor care if she did It was however a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world and Amy s beauty loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the Divine Mother while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart On the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her and came every day to sit alone thinking good thoughts and praying the dear God to preserve her sister Esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross but Amy hung it up and did not use it feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers The little girl was very sincere in all this for being left alone outside the safe home nest she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender Friend whose fatherly love most closely surrounds His little children She missed her mother s help to understand and rule herself but having been taught where to look she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly But Amy was a young pilgrim and just now her burden seemed very heavy She tried to forget herself to keep cheerful and be satisfied with doing right though no one saw or praised her for it In her first effort at being very very good she decided to make her will as Aunt March had done so that if she did fall ill and die her possessions might be justly and generously divided It cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old lady s jewels During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms and when the good natured Frenchwoman had signed her name Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie whom she wanted as a second witness As it was a rainy day she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers and took Polly with her for company In this room there was a wardrobe full of old fashioned costumes with which Esther allowed her to play and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades and parade up and down before the long mirror making stately curtsies and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears So busy was she on this day that she did not hear Laurie s ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro flirting her fan and tossing her head on which she wore a great pink turban contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat She was obliged to walk carefully for she had on high heeled shoes and as Laurie told Jo afterward it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her imitating her as well as he could and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim Ain t we fine Get along you fright Hold your tongue Kiss me dear Ha Ha Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment lest it should offend her majesty Laurie tapped and was graciously received Sit down and rest while I put these things away then I want to consult you about a very serious matter said Amy when she had shown her splendor and driven Polly into a corner That bird is the trial of my life she continued removing the pink mountain from her head while Laurie seated himself astride a chair Yesterday when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a mouse Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage so I went to let him out and found a big spider there I poked it out and it ran under the bookcase Polly marched straight after it stooped down and peeped under the bookcase saying in his funny way with a cock of his eye Come out and take a walk my dear I couldn t help laughing which made Poll swear and Aunt woke up and scolded us both Did the spider accept the old fellow s invitation asked Laurie yawning Yes out it came and away ran Polly frightened to death and scrambled up on Aunt s chair calling out Catch her Catch her Catch her as I chased the spider That s a lie Oh lor cried the parrot pecking at Laurie s toes I d wring your neck if you were mine you old torment cried Laurie shaking his fist at the bird who put his head on one side and gravely croaked Allyluyer bless your buttons dear Now I m ready said Amy shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket I want you to read that please and tell me if it is legal and right I felt I ought to do it for life is uncertain and I don t want any ill feeling over my tomb Laurie bit his lips and turning a little from the pensive speaker read the following document with praiseworthy gravity considering the spelling MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT I Amy Curtis March being in my sane mind go give and bequeethe all my earthly property viz to wit namely To my

it into your head Did anyone tell you about Beth s giving away her things asked Laurie soberly as Amy laid a bit of red tape with sealing wax a taper and a standish before him She explained and then asked anxiously What about Beth I m sorry I spoke but as I did I ll tell you She felt so ill one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg her cats to you and the poor old doll to Jo who would love it for her sake She was sorry she had so little to give and left locks of hair to the rest of us and her best love to Grandpa She never thought of a will Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper Amy s face was full of trouble but she only said Don t people put sort of postscripts to their wills sometimes Yes codicils they call them Put one in mine then that I wish all my curls cut off and given round to my friends I forgot it but I want it done though it will spoil my looks Laurie added it smiling at Amy s last and greatest sacrifice Then he amused her for an hour and was much interested in all her trials But when he came to go Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips Is there really any danger about Beth I m afraid there is but we must hope for the best so don t cry dear And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting When he had gone she went to her little chapel and sitting in the twilight prayed for Beth with streaming tears and an aching heart feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister CHAPTER TWENTY CONFIDENTIAL I don t think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters Such hours are beautiful to live but very hard to describe so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness and that Meg s tender hope was realized for when Beth woke from that long healing sleep the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and Mother s face Too weak to wonder at anything she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last Then she slept again and the girls waited upon their mother for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep Hannah had dished up an astonishing breakfast for the traveler finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks while they listened to her whispered account of Father s state Mr Brooke s promise to stay and nurse him the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey and the unspeakable comfort Laurie s hopeful face had given her when she arrived worn out with fatigue anxiety and cold What a strange yet pleasant day that was So brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow So quiet and reposeful within for everyone slept spent with watching and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes and lay at rest like storm beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor Mrs March would not leave Beth s side but rested in the big chair waking often to look at touch and brood over her child like a miser over some recovered treasure Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy and told his story so well that Aunt March actually sniffed herself and never once said I told you so Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit She dried her tears quickly restrained her impatience to see her mother and never even thought of the turquoise ring when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie s opinion that she behaved like a capital little woman Even Polly seemed impressed for he called her a good girl blessed her buttons and begged her to come and take a walk dear in his most affable tone She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather but discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact she persuaded him to rest on the sofa while she wrote a note to her mother She was a long time about it and when she returned he was stretched out with both arms under his head sound asleep while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity After a while they began to think he was not going to wake up till night and I m not sure that he would had he not been effectually roused by Amy s cry of joy at sight of her mother There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day but it is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all when she sat in her mother s lap and told her trials receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses They were alone together in the chapel to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her On the contrary I like it very much dear looking from the dusty rosary to the well worn little book and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen It is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet when things vex or grieve us There are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way I think my little girl is learning this Yes Mother and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I ve tried to make The woman s face is not good it s too beautiful for me to draw but the baby is done better and I love it very much I like to think He was a little child once for then I don t seem so far away and that helps me As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother s knee Mrs March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile She said nothing but Amy understood the look and after a minute s pause she added gravely I wanted to speak to you about this but I forgot it Aunt gave me the ring today She called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said I was a credit to her and she d like to keep me always She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on as it s too big I d like to wear them Mother can I They are very pretty but I think you re rather too young for such ornaments Amy said Mrs March looking at the plump little hand with the band of sky blue stones on the forefinger and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together I ll try not to be vain said Amy I don t think I like it only because it s so pretty but I want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet to remind me of something Do you mean Aunt March asked her mother laughing No to remind me not to be selfish Amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan I ve thought a great deal lately about my bundle of naughties and being selfish is the largest one in it so I m going to try hard to cure it if I can Beth isn t selfish and that s the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her People wouldn t feel so bad about me if I was sick and I don t deserve to have them but I d like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so I m going to try and be like Beth all I can I m apt to forget my resolutions but if I had something always about me to remind me I guess I should do better May we try this way Yes but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet Wear your ring dear and do your best I think you will prosper for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle Now I must go back to Beth Keep up your heart little daughter and we will soon have you home again That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the traveler s safe arrival Jo slipped upstairs into Beth s room and finding her mother in her usual place stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair with a worried gesture and an undecided look What is it deary asked Mrs March holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence I want to tell you something Mother About Meg How quickly you guessed Yes it s about her and though it s a little thing it fidgets me Beth is asleep Speak low and tell me all about it That Moffat hasn t been here I hope asked Mrs March rather sharply No I should have shut the door in his face if he had said Jo settling herself on the floor at her mother s feet Last summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences and only one was returned We forgot about it till Teddy told me that Mr Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn t dare say so she was so young and he so poor Now isn t it a dreadful state of things Do you think Meg cares for him asked Mrs March with an anxious look Mercy me I don t know anything about love and such nonsense cried Jo with a funny mixture of interest and contempt In novels the girls show it by starting and blushing fainting away growing thin and acting like fools Now Meg does not do anything of the sort She eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers I forbid him to do it but he doesn t mind me as he ought Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John Who cried Jo staring Mr Brooke I call him John now We fell into the way of doing so at the hospital and he likes it Oh dear I know you ll take his part He s been good to Father and you won t send him away but let Meg marry him if she wants to Mean thing To go petting Papa and helping you just to wheedle you into liking him And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak My dear don t get angry about it and I will tell you how it happened John went with me at Mr Laurence s request and was so devoted to poor Father that we couldn t help getting fond of him He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg for he told us he loved her but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could He is a truly excellent young man and we could not refuse to listen to him but I will not consent to Meg s engaging herself so young Of course not It would be idiotic I knew there was mischief brewing I felt it and now it s worse than I imagined I just wish I could marry Meg myself and keep her safe in the family This odd arrangement made Mrs March smile but she said gravely Jo I confide in you and don t wish you to say anything to Meg yet When John comes back and I see them together I can judge better of her feelings toward him She ll see those handsome eyes that she talks about and then it will be all up with her She s got such a soft heart it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters and pinched me when I spoke of i
